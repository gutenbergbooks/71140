                     _To the Reverend Mr. H――――._

                                            _London, Dec. 23, 1742._

_My dear brother H――――_,

I Thank you for your kind and very agreeable letter. It was refreshing
to my soul, and stirred me to give thanks on your behalf. I am
surprized that you are not turned off, since you now so clearly preach
the everlasting gospel. But our Saviour has the hearts of all men in
his hands, and he turneth them when and wheresoever he pleaseth. O my
dear brother, I hope nothing will deter you from preaching the glad
tidings of salvation to a world lying in the wicked one. I would not
but be a poor despised minister of JESUS CHRIST for ten thousand worlds.
This I am persuaded is the language of my dear friend’s heart:

                                I.

              _For this let men revile my name,_
              _No cross I shun, I fear no shame:_
              _All hail reproach, and welcome pain;_
              _Only thy terrors, LORD, restrain._

                                II.

              _The love of CHRIST doth him constrain_
              _To seek the wand’ring souls of men;_
              _With cries, entreaties, tears to save,_
              _And snatch them from the gaping grave._

Go on, thou man of GOD; and may the LORD cause thy bow to abide in
strength! Glad should I be to come and shoot some gospel arrows in
_Devonshire_; but the cloud seems now to point toward _America_. My
dear family calls loudly for me. Our LORD has wonderfully of late
interposed on their behalf. GOD willing, I intend shortly to send you
an account of the Orphan-house, and my last volume of sermons, with
some other things. Blessed be GOD for making any of my poor writings
of use to your dear soul. Surely I had need proclaim free grace on the
house-top; if I did not, the stones would cry out against me. O my dear
brother, what a mystery of love is the mystery of godliness? Whilst
I am writing the fire kindles. This fire has also of late kindled in
many hearts. Our large society goes on well. We have many that walk in
the comforts of the Holy Ghost. I hear of glorious things from various
parts. I hope ere long we shall hear of persons going from post to post,
and crying, “Babylon is fallen, Babylon is fallen.” I trust you, my
dear Sir, will be made a happy instrument in the Mediator’s kingdom,
of pulling down satan’s strongholds. Pray write me word, how the war is
going on between _Michael_ and the dragon. For the present, adieu. My
tender love to all the lovers of JESUS CHRIST. Accept the same from, my
dear brother,

                 Yours most affectionately in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER CCCCXCIX.


                     _To Mr. R――――, in Edinburgh._

                                             _London, Dec. 24, 1742._

_Dear Mr. R――――_,

IT has given me some concern that I could not answer your kind and
acceptable letter before. As our Saviour will give me freedom, I shall
send you a few lines now. I think I may say to you, as _Luther_ said
to _Melanchton_, _Nimis es nullus_. You are kept in bondage by a false
humility. It is good to see ourselves poor, and exceeding vile; but
if that sight and feeling prevent our looking up to, and exerting
ourselves for our dear Saviour, it becomes criminal, and robs the soul
of much comfort. I can speak this by dear-bought experience. How often
have I been kept from speaking and acting for GOD, by a sight of my
own unworthiness; but now I see that the more unworthy I am, the more
fit to work for JESUS, because he will get much glory in working by
such mean instruments; and the more he has for given me, the more I
ought to love and serve him. Fired with a sense of his unspeakable
loving-kindness, I dare to go out and tell poor sinners that a lamb was
slain for them; and that he will have mercy on sinners as such, of whom
indeed I am chief. I wish my dear friend was in this respect not almost,
but altogether such as I am. Well would it be with him, and happy would
he then be. Upon the receipt of yours, I prayed the LORD to open your
mouth. The language of my heart for you, myself, and all the Redeemer’s
witnesses, is this;

              _Ah! LORD, enlarge their scanty thought,_
              _To see the wonders thou hast wrought;_
              _Unloose the stammering tongue, to tell_
              _Thy love immense, unsearchable._

I bless our LORD for giving you such freedom with himself, though
you cannot speak so freely to others. Prayers wrought by his own
spirit, he will hear and answer. It is most god-like to be frequent in
intercession. It is the constant employment of the Son of GOD in heaven.
I rejoice to hear the work of GOD goes on among you in _Scotland_.
Blessed be GOD, it prospers in our hands here, in _Wales_, and in
various places. That it may prosper more and more, and be daily carried
on in your precious soul, is the hearty prayer of, dear Mr. _R――――_,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                               LETTER D.


                    _To Miss S――――, in Edinburgh._

                                             _London, Dec. 24, 1742._

_Dear Miss S――――_,

CONTINUAL avocations about my master’s business, has prevented my
answering your kind letter. It gladdened my heart, because it brought
me the glad tidings of your being accepted in the beloved; and knowing
that you are so, what does the LORD require of you now, but to walk
humbly with him? Beg him to shew you more and more of your evil
heart, that you may ever remain a poor sinner at the feet of the once
crucified, but now exalted Lamb of GOD. There you will be happy. There
you will find shelter from all your enemies. My prayer therefore for
you, dear Miss, is this:

              _Continue still thy love, dear Lamb,_
              _Safe hide her in thy wounds;_
              _There may she dwell in all that love_
              _The ransom’d soul surrounds._

The comforts you have already experienced, as well as your trials, are
but earnests of what you will hereafter meet with in the spiritual life.
But fear nothing, neither be over thoughtful for the morrow; you have
an all-gracious and almighty Saviour to guide and protect you. He will
not leave you, until he hath lodged you safe in glory. There the wicked
shall cease from troubling, and your weary soul will enjoy an eternal
rest. Perhaps I may not see you again, till I meet you in the world of
spirits. That grace and peace may be multiplied upon your dear soul, is
the hearty prayer of, dear Miss _S――――_,

      Your most affectionate friend and servant in JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER DI.


                            _To Mr. T――――._

                                                   _January 9, 1743._

_Dear Sir_,

I Remember, when in _Scotland_ last year, how heartily your good people
joined in praise and thanksgiving, for the deliverance GOD had wrought
out for the inhabitants of _Georgia_; and I hope I shall never forget
how liberally they contributed to the necessities of the orphans,
though they knew not but at that time both orphans and Orphan-house
were in the enemies hand. As this was an uncommon event, I send you
herewith part of the proclamation for a day of thanksgiving to almighty
GOD, for putting an end to this _Spanish Invasion_. It runs thus:

ALMIGHTY GOD has in all ages shewn his power and mercy, in the
marvellous and gracious deliverance of his church, and in the
protection of righteous and religious kings and states, professing his
holy and eternal truth, from the open invasion, wicked conspiracies,
and malicious practices of all the enemies thereof. He hath by the
manifestation of his providence delivered us from the hands of the
_Spaniards_: they, with forty sail of small gallies and other craft,
came into _Cumberland_ Sound; but such a terror came upon them that
they fled. With another fleet of thirty-six ships and vessels they came
into _Jekyl_ Sound, and after a sharp fight became masters thereof; we
having only four vessels to oppose their force. We engaged them for the
space of four hours, and not one of us was killed, though many of the
enemy perished, and five were killed by one shot only. They landed four
thousand five hundred men, according to the account of the prisoners,
and even of _Englishmen_, who escaped from them. The first party
marched up through the woods to this town, and was within sight thereof,
when GOD delivered them into our hands, though we were but few in
number. They fought and were soon dispersed and fled. Another party
which supported them, also fought; but were soon put to flight. We may
truly say, the hand of the LORD fought for us; for in two attacks more
than five hundred fled before fifty. At first they seemed to fight with
courage; and the grenadiers particularly charged with great resolution;
but their shot did not take place, insomuch that none of ours were
killed; but they were broken and pursued with great slaughter, and
by the report of the prisoners since taken, upwards of two hundred
men never returned to their camp. They also came up with their half
galleys towards the town, and returned without so much as firing one
shot, leaving behind them some cannon, and many things they had taken.
Twenty-eight sail attacked _Fort-William_, in which were only fifty men.
After three hours fight, they went away and left the province, and were
pursued as far as Saint _John’s_. So that by this whole expedition, no
more than two of ours were taken and two killed. We may therefore truly
say, the LORD hath done great things for us, who has delivered us out
of the hands of the enemy.

Having taken the premises into consideration, I do hereby order,
that _Sunday_ the twenty-fifth instant be observed as a day of public
thanksgiving to almighty GOD for his great deliverance, in having put
an end to the _Spanish_ Invasion: and that all persons do solemnize the
same in a christian and religious manner, and abstain from drunkenness,
and any other wicked and dissolute testimonies of joy.

Given under my hand and seal, this twenty-fourth day of _July_, at
_Frederica_ in _Georgia_, _Anno Domini_ one thousand seven hundred and
forty-two.

Business prevents my enlarging further at this time, and indeed I chuse
rather to leave you to make your own remarks on the inclosed. I only
observe in general that as a tincture of piety runs through the whole,
and all the glory given to him to whom all glory is due, it will be as
acceptable to you as it was to,

                                Yours,
                                                              _G. W._

                                              _London, Feb. 4, 1743._

_My very dear Mr. H――――_,

I Bless GOD on your behalf. I thank him for visiting your dear soul,
and making you useful to others.――Assuredly the LORD has called you to
your present work.――Abide in it. Go on and prosper. The LORD will be
with you. If we have an association in _Wiltshire_ soon, will you chuse
to be with us? I expect shortly now to move hence; but my way is quite
blocked up from going abroad. I will send you word, when I shall be at
_Bristol_. I will salute you and your friend with, “Come in, ye blessed
of the LORD.” I have just published a fresh account of the Orphan-house,
and prefixed the plan. I shall be glad to hear from you often. Be as
particular in respect to the society as you can. The LORD is still with
us. Blessed be his holy name! My tender love to all. That the glorious
_Emmanuel_ may be with your soul more and more, is the hearty prayer of,
my dear Mr. _H――――_,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DIII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                        _Gloucester, March 24, 1743._

_My dear Sir_,

AN effectual door is opened in these parts. On _Saturday_ night I
preached here. The LORD was with me. On _Sunday_ morning I preached
again in a barn. It was a good time to me and the people. Dear Mr.
_P――――_ was here, and tears of love and joy were running down his aged
cheeks almost all the while. He was, like good old _Simeon_, ready to
cry out, “LORD, now lettest thy servant depart in peace.” At noon I
preached at Mr. _F――――r_’s on the hill, to a glorious auditory indeed.
Here JESUS CHRIST displayed his power, and caused much of his glory
to pass before us. At four I preached again in a field near _Stroud_,
where was a great congregation consisting of many, many thousands.
The LORD helped and blessed me much here also. Afterwards I went to
the new house at _Hampton_, and the glory of the LORD filled it. It is
exceeding commodious for our purpose. I preached in the court-yard on
_Monday_ noon, to a large auditory. _Monday_ evening the LORD gave me
a good time at _Pitchcomb_. Both brother _C――――_ and brother _A――――_’s
society met at _Hampton_, and the LORD met with us. Brother _C――――_
is certainly called of GOD. All call him a second _Bunyan_. I believe
he must give himself wholly to the work. Such a hardy worker with his
hands, and hearty preacher at the same time, I have scarce known.
On _Tuesday_ a man was hung in chains at _Hampton Common_.――A more
miserable spectacle I have not seen. I preached in the morning to a
great auditory about a mile off the place of execution. I intended
doing the same after the criminal was turned off; but the weather was
very violent.――Thousands and thousands came and staid to hear; but,
through misinformation, kept on the top of the hill, while I preached
in the bottom. After this I came to _Gloucester_, and preached in the
evening in a barn: a night much to be remembered! This morning I
preached again, and dined with Mr. _E――――d I――――s_ and some more at
Mr. _E――――_’s. I am just going to my evening lecture, and to-morrow I
shall leave _Gloucester_ for a few days. The association is put off for
a week, so I shall have more time in _Gloucestershire_. Never did I see
people more hungry and simple. Many come telling me what the LORD did
for their souls when I was here last. To him be all the glory! Brother
_A――――_ is now with me. He must be in the country ’till the house is
more settled. I am sure GOD called me here.

                              Yours, &c.

                                        _Gloucester, March 29, 1743._

_My dear Sir_,

I Now sit down to fulfil my promise made to you last night.――I think
in a former letter I gave you an account of what the LORD had done for
and by me since I left _London_, though indeed I cannot tell you the
hundredth part. On _Tuesday_ evening I preached at _Gloucester_ with as
convincing, soul-edifying power, as ever I felt in my life. The barn,
though made more commodious, was and is generally quite crouded. On
_Friday_ morning I preached again; and afterwards went to _Hampton_;
the snow falling and freezing on us all the way. In the evening I
preached at _Chalford_, upon “walking with GOD:” he was with me and
the auditory. On _Saturday_ I preached at _Ruscom_ in the morning,
and at _King-stanley_ in the afternoon. In the evening, I visited
brother _C――――_’s gracious society; and afterwards rode to _Hampton_,
which made about twenty miles. The congregations on account of the
weather were not so great, but our Saviour most richly fed us. The
word distilled like the dew; and at _Stanley_ I think I was in the
very suburbs of heaven. O free grace! On _Sunday_ morning I preached
at _Dursley_, about seven miles from _Hampton_, where our dear brother
_A――――_ had been taken down the _Sunday_ before; but no one was
permitted to touch or molest us. The congregation consisted of some
thousands, and the word came with a most gloriously convincing power.
I came away rejoicing, and in the afternoon preached to about ten
thousand on _Hampton_ common, at what the people now call _Whitefield’s
Tump_, because I preached there first. I cannot tell you what a solemn
occasion that was. I perceive a great alteration in the people since
I was in these parts last. They did indeed hang on me to hear the
word. It ran and was glorified. In the evening, we had a most precious
meeting with the two united societies in the new house at _Hampton_.
Surely many thereabouts will walk with GOD. Last night and this morning
I preached again with great power; preaching in _Gloucestershire_ is
now like preaching at the tabernacle at _London_. This evening I am to
preach again; and after that to hold our first love-feast.――What our
LORD does for us hereafter, you shall hear in my next. And now, my dear
Sir, help me to be thankful, and bless the LORD for all his mercies
conferred on

           Your unworthy friend, and his worthless servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER DV.


                            _To the Same._

                                         _Gloucester, April 2, 1743._

_Dear Sir_,

MY soul is kept exceeding chearful; and greater and more continued
freedom in preaching, I never experienced, than since I have been
in _Gloucester_ and _Gloucestershire_. On _Tuesday_ evening we had a
blessed love-feast. On _Wednesday_ morning I preached here with great
sweetness; and at noon at _Painswick_.――In the evening I preached at
Mr. _F――――_’s, in the place where the LORD met us remarkably one night
about a twelvemonth ago. He met us again most delightfully, not in
terror, but in love: by which I guessed how the gospel had gained
ground in a twelvemonth’s time. After this I visited dear brother
_C――――_’s society, and then rode to _Hampton_, with brothers _A――――_
and _G――――_, praising and blessing GOD. On _Wednesday_ noon I preached
at _Quarhouse_, from the stump where old Mr. _Cole_ used to stand. It
was an alarming time. My soul enjoyed exceeding great liberty. In the
evening I preached in the new house at _Hampton_ to many hundreds, and
afterwards met the society. Yesterday morning I came hither. At noon
and at night I preached in the barn; it was quite crouded. It would
have rejoiced you to have been with us. This morning I am to preach
again, and shall take my leave at night. My dear Sir, help me to extol
free grace, and expect to hear of greater things than these from,

                            Ever yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER DVI.


                          _To brother S――――._

                            _Waterford (South Wales,) April 7, 1743._

_My Dear Brother_,

ON _Monday_ I received your letter of _April 2_; but till now, have
had no opportunity of answering it. I preached and took my leave of the
_Gloucester_ people with mutual and great concern, on _Sunday_ evening
last. It was past one in the morning, before I could lay my weary body
down.――At five I rose again, sick for want of rest; but I was enabled
to get on horseback and ride to Mr. _F――――_’s, where I preached to a
large congregation, who came there at seven in the morning, hoping to
feel the power of a risen LORD. They were not disappointed of their
hope. At ten I read prayers, and preached from these words,――“I am the
resurrection and the life,” and afterwards was helped to administer
the sacrament in _Stonehouse_ church. Then I rode to _Stroud_, where I
was enabled to preach to about twelve thousand, with uncommon freedom
and power, in Mrs. _G――――_’s field. Much of the divine presence was
there.――About six in the evening I preached to about the like number
on _Hampton Common_; but scarce ever with a more pleasing convincing
power. The order and solemnity wherewith the people broke up, was
very instructive. After this I went to _Hampton_, and held a general
love-feast with the united societies. My soul was kept close to JESUS;
my bodily strength renewed; and I went to-bed about midnight, very
chearful and very happy. The next morning I went and preached near
_Dursley_, to some thousands, with great convictions accompanying the
word. About seven I reached _Bristol_, and preached with wonderful
power to a full congregation at _Smith’s Hall_; and afterwards spent
the evening agreeably with Mr. _C――――_ of _Bath_, and some other dear
friends. On _Tuesday_ morning I preached again to a full congregation,
and then set out for this place, where we came about eight in the
evening, and had sweet and profitable conversation with Mr. _B――――_
and some others of the brethren. We sung an hymn, prayed, and parted
in great harmony. On _Wednesday_ about noon I opened the association
with a close and solemn discourse upon walking with GOD. Indeed much
of GOD was with us. The brethren and the people felt much of the divine
presence. Afterwards we betook ourselves to business: several matters
of great importance were dispatched. We broke up about seven, and met
again about ten, and continued settling the affairs of the societies
till about two in the morning. On _Thursday_ we sat again till about
four in the afternoon; then, after taking a little refreshment, and
talking warmly of the things of GOD, I preached with great freedom
upon the believer’s rest, and then we went on with our business, and
finished our association about midnight: all acknowledged that GOD had
been with us, and blessed him for the same. Perhaps in a month I may
come to _London_; but it seems to be the will of the LORD I should stay
in _Wales_ about a fortnight, and take a tour into _Pembrokeshire_.
Great doors are open there. Our Saviour keeps me very happy indeed;
and is, I believe, preparing greater blessings, for

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                            _Lantrissant, (in Wales) April 10, 1743._

_Dear Sir_,

OUR blessed master still countenances my feeble labours. Yesterday I
preached at _Cardiff_ to a large congregation. The greatest scoffers
sat quiet, and the children of GOD felt the divine presence. In the
evening I went to _Ful-mon_. Mrs. _I――――_ received us kindly. GOD was
pleased to speak for me in the society where I preached. This morning
I preached again. It was a most remarkable time. I have been just now
preaching with great power here. Dear brother _H――――_ is preaching in
_Welch_. The people are very simple. I wrote to you from _Waterford_. I
must write a letter or two more, and then away out of town. My kind and
tender love to all. The LORD be with you.

                            I am yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DVIII.


                            _To the Same._

                                           _Swanzey, April 12, 1743._
_My dear Friend_,

I Hope all is well with you. Great things are doing in _Wales_.――An
effectual door is opened for preaching the everlasting gospel.
Yesterday I preached at _Neath_, (seven miles from this place) from a
balcony, to about three thousand souls in the street. The LORD was with
me of a truth. This morning I preached here to about four thousand with
great power. About one I preached at _Harbrook_, four miles off; and
am now returned to preach here again.――Our Saviour has prepared the
way before him. O free grace! Dear brother _H――――_ has discoursed in
_Welch_ yesterday and to day.

                              Ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._


Postscript. Past seven in the evening. I have just now done preaching.
Swanzey is taken! I never preached with a more convincing power. Many
of the rich and great were present. The congregation larger than in the
morning. Free grace for ever!

_My dear Friend_,

I Wrote to you from several places; and all my letters have, or will
I trust come to hand. I can yet send you more glad tidings. But words
cannot express what the LORD has done for your unworthy friend, and his
own dear people’s souls. On _Monday_ I preached at a place in the way,
and afterwards at _Neath_, a sea port town, to about three thousand
people: all was quiet, and the power of JESUS was much there. Then I
went to _Swanzey_ seven miles from _Neath_.――On _Tuesday_ I preached,
and the LORD was with me. In the evening I went to _Llanelthy_, eight
miles from _Swanzey_. There I preached twice on _Wednesday_ with great
power to a large congregation; and in the evening near _Aberquilley_,
five miles from thence. On _Thursday_ I preached at _Carmarthen_, one
of the greatest and most polite places in _Wales_; in the morning from
the top of the cross: in the evening from a table near it. It was the
great sessions. The justices desired I would stay till they rose, and
they would come. Accordingly they did, and many thousands more; and
several people of quality. JESUS was much with me, and I hope much
good work was done. Several sent for me to their houses. Dear brother
_H――――_ exhorts in every place. I have just been preaching, and it
would rejoice your heart to see what is doing. I want room and time to
tell you all. In about ten days I hope to be near _Bristol_. In the
mean while, I am, dear friend,

                              Ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

SINCE I left _Larn_, from whence I wrote to you, the LORD has dealt
most bountifully with me. I went that evening to _Narbatt_, where I
preached to some thousands with great power. On _Saturday_ I preached
at _Newton_, and afterwards at _Jefferson_ to several thousand
souls, very like the _Kingswood_ colliers. This morning I preached at
_Llassivran_, and had as it were a _Moor-fields_ congregation; and this
afternoon I preached to about the same number near this town. I also
read prayers. Where I have been, the people call loudly again. A most
effectual door is opened in _South Wales_. I hope to be with you in a
few weeks. I am glad of such news from _Georgia_. Blessed be GOD, he
will take care of me and mine. Hearty love attends you and all, from

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                                        _Carmarthen, April 20, 1743._

_My dear Friend_,

SINCE I wrote from _Haverfordwest_, I preached yesterday at eight in
the morning to about eight thousand people in this place, and in the
afternoon to several thousands at _Narbatt_, both times with great
power. This morning I preached at _Larn_, and coming over in the ferry
had the unexpected compliment paid me, of one ship firing several guns,
and of some others hoisting their flags. This afternoon I preached
at a little town called _Kidwilly_, to a large congregation; and came
this evening here. One of the ministers preached much against me last
_Sunday_, and mentioned me by name; but, like my other opposers (and
like the viper biting the file) he only hurt himself. I am as it were
in a new, but very unthought of pleasant world. O how many thousands
within these few days have heard the word! I thought to see you next
week; but as I am here, perhaps it may be best to go round now, and so
be at _London_ at Pentecost. In about a fortnight, therefore, you may
expect to see me.

                              Ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._

                                          _Bhuadder, April 23, 1743._

_My dear Friend_,

I Wrote to you from _Haverford_ and _Carmarthen_. I preached there
twice on _Thursday_ to about ten thousand people, and dear Mr. _R――――_
preached after me. Yesterday we had another blessed association; and
have now settled all the counties in _Wales_. Our LORD was wonderfully
with us. You cannot tell how delighted the brethren went away. Indeed
they seemed filled as with new wine. Last night we came hither to a
little inn. A sweet retreat from the rain. I must away to preach this
morning. Help me, my dear man, to be thankful. I kindly salute you and
yours, and am,

                              Ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._

           _Guenfithen, near the Hay in Radnorshire, April 25, 1743._

_My dear Sir_,

I Wrote to you on _Saturday_ morning; afterwards I preached at
_Llangathan_ in the church, to a great congregation; I then went about
ten miles, and preached at _Landovery_ in the evening, and on _Sunday_
morning. GOD was with us each time. On _Sunday_ evening I preached to a
large and polite auditory at _Brecon_, fifteen miles from _Landovery_.
――This morning I preached at _Trevecka_, and just now at this place,
with as great freedom, power and melting, almost as we have seen. It
is now past seven at night, and I have seven or eight _Welsh_ miles to
go. I am glad you are so happy in JESUS. My body is weak, but I am at
the Redeemer’s feet, and he reigns king in my heart, and causes me to
rejoice and triumph over all. Help me to praise him. Brother _H――――_
salutes you all. The LORD be with you.

                           Ever, ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._

                                        _Gloucester, April 29, 1743._

_My dear Sir_,

I Am at present strengthening myself in the LORD my GOD. These words
have much refreshed me, “And the LORD was with _David_, whithersoever
he went.” After I wrote my last from a gentlewoman’s near the _Hay_,
I went towards _Builth_, and got into my lodgings about one, and into
my bed about two o’clock in the morning. The next day I preached at
_Builth_, with much of the Redeemer’s presence. Then I rode to the
_Gore_, the last place I preached at in _Wales_; and indeed our Saviour
kept the good wine ’till last: he made our cup to overflow.――Between
eight and nine at night we set out for _Leominster_, and reached there
between two and three in the morning. At eleven, and three, I preached.
It was quite fallow ground. The LORD broke it up, and gave me a blessed
entrance into _Herefordshire_. All glory be to his great Name! The same
night I lay at _Hereford_. Even there some of our LORD’s disciples were
to be found, as also at _Ross_, where we baited yesterday. In both
places I might have preached, would time have permitted; but I was
hastening to _Gloucester_, where the good Shepherd of _Israel_ brought
us in peace and safety about eight in the evening; after having in
about three weeks travelled about four hundred _English_ miles, spent
three days in attending two associations, preached about forty times,
visited about thirteen towns, and passed through seven counties. Here
then will I set up my _Ebenezer_, thank the adorable JESUS for these
and all other his mercies, and from the bottom of my heart give him all
the glory. I know my dearest friend will join with me, and say a hearty
Amen. “Even so, LORD JESUS. Amen and Amen!”――――Last night and this
morning I preached here. Since my departure the barn hath been turned
into a commodious chapel. I shall preach there again, GOD willing, this
evening, and to-morrow morning; in the country on _Sunday_ next, and
for all as I know, shall come to _London_ on _Monday_ evening. One of
the simple _Apperly_ souls died in peace a few days ago. “Praise ye the
LORD, for his mercy endureth for ever.”

                            Yours, &c. &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                                               _London, May 6, 1743._

_My dear Brother_,

YOUR very kind letter I had not the pleasure of receiving ’till
yesterday. It was very acceptable, and knits my heart closer to you
than ever. I love your honest soul, and long for that time, when the
disciples of CHRIST of different sects shall be joined in far closer
fellowship one with another. Our divisions have grieved my heart.
I heartily approve of the meeting of the chief labourers together.
The free grace of the ever-blessed JESUS melts me down. He has been
exceeding kind to me of late, and shewn me that, vile as I am, he will
not lay me aside. I am just returned from a circuit of about 400 miles.
I have been as far as _Haverfordwest_, and was enabled to preach with
great power. Thousands and tens of thousands flocked to hear the word,
and the souls of GOD’s children were much refreshed. I have been also
at two associations in _Wales_. The work begins now to shew itself.
Many are taking root downward, and bearing fruit upward. Ere long I
trust they will fill the land. I am glad the LORD hath opened fresh
doors for you, my dear brother. The rams horns are sounding about
_Jericho_; surely the towering walls will at length fall down. But we
must have patience. He that believeth, doth not make haste. The rams
horns must go round seven times. Our divisions in _England_ have the
worst aspect, while they are now united in _Wales_: but even this shall
work for good, and cause the Redeemer’s glory to shine more conspicuous.
This is my comfort; “The government is upon his shoulders,” and he is
a “wonderful counsellor.”

                  _And whatso’er thou wilt,_
                  _Thou dost, thou King of Kings!_
                  _What thy unerring wisdom plans_
                  _Thy power to being brings._

But where am I running? Pardon me. I am writing to my dear Mr. _I――――_.
I rejoice in the expectation of seeing you in town. I hope to be in
town at that time, and to enjoy some of our former happy seasons. In
the mean while, I salute you from my inmost soul, and desire, as often
as opportunity offers, a close correspondence may be kept up between
you, and, my dear brother,

         Your most affectionate unworthy brother and servant,
                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Brother_,

A Day or two ago, I had the pleasure of receiving a letter from you,
which I find was written some time since, but came not to hand, as I
was out of town. Accept my thanks, though late, and let the blessed
JESUS be praised, again and again, for causing his children to love and
esteem unworthy, hell-deserving me. O, my dear brother, “Love is of GOD,
and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in GOD, and GOD in him.” Glad am
I that our Saviour is getting himself the victory in your parts, and
that fresh doors are opened for our dear brother _I――――_ to preach the
everlasting gospel. I have been just writing to him; and now improve a
few moments to send you a line also. Blessed be our glorious _Emmanuel_,
I can tell you of new and glorious conquests made of late. I am but
just returned from a circuit of 400 miles in _Gloucestershire_ and
_South Wales_. _Dagon_ hath every where fallen before the ark, and the
fields are white ready unto harvest. The congregations were very large,
and I was never enabled to preach with greater power. I purpose staying
here about a month, and once more to attack the prince of darkness in
_Moor-fields_, when the holidays come. Many precious souls have been
captivated with CHRIST’s love in that wicked place. _Jerusalem_ sinners
bring most glory to the Redeemer. Where I shall go next, I cannot yet
tell. If my Master should point out the way, a visit to _Yorkshire_
would be very agreeable. Perhaps _Exeter_ and _Cornwall_ may be the
next places. That is dry ground. I love to range in such places. O
my dear brother, continue to pray for me, and help me to praise the
blessed Lamb of GOD. Indeed I pray for you, and the redeemed sinners,
amongst whom you are. That the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls may
fill you with all peace and joy in believing, is the hearty prayer of,
my dear brother,

                 Yours most affectionately in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear faithful Friend and Brother_,

AFTER watching, and praying, and striving some days for direction and
assistance, I now sit down to write you a letter; though I know not
well what to say or do. The concern I have felt for you, and my dear
family, has had an effect on my body, and increased that weakness,
which the season of the year, my constant labours, and continual care
upon various accounts, have brought upon me. In the midst of all,
my soul I trust grows, and is kept happy in the blessed JESUS. His
strength is daily made perfect in my weakness, and I am made more than
conqueror through his love. I am somewhat concerned, that scarce any of
my letters have reached your hands. I was glad, however, to find, that
you had received one dated in _May_ last. Since that, I hope you have
received more. I rejoice that our loving Saviour has not permitted
you to want. You are his family, and he would not detain me from you,
had not he determined to provide for you in my absence. I fear I have
been sinfully impatient to come over. I think, I could be sold a slave
to serve at the gallies, rather than you and my dear Orphan-family
should want. Sometimes my wicked heart has said, “if I know I should
have staid so long, I would not have come over to _England_ at all.”
But GOD’s thoughts are not as our thoughts. It is best to be kept at
his feet, waiting to know what he would have us to do. By and by we
shall know all; ’till then, let us wait patiently; against hope may we
believe in hope, and being strong in faith give glory to GOD. After I
have fought the LORD’s battles in _Moor-fields_ these holidays, I think
to take a tour into _Cornwall_ and _Wales_, and perhaps, to _Ireland_.
I have sometimes thought I am detained on purpose to go there. I wonder
not at your silence. You may well expect me; but I must not mention
it, lest my impatient heart should again say, “LORD, why wilt thou not
let me go?” My first fellow-traveller, scarce a day passes without my
speaking of, and often praying for you. Old love has revived long since
in my soul. I am persuaded, our LORD will reward you even in this life,
for your fidelity to unworthy me. “Be strong in the LORD and in the
power of his might.” While I am writing the fire kindles, and I almost
forget my bodily weakness. The LORD be with you. I hear the _Spaniards_
intend a second invasion; but those words still follow and comfort me,
“The enemies which you have seen, you shall see no more for ever.” You
are the LORD’s family; he will take care of you; fear them not. I have
many things to impart, when I see you face to face. ’Till then the LORD
JESUS be with your spirit, and grant that you and yours may increase
with all the increase of GOD. In bonds of an eternal friendship, with
greater affection than words can well express, I subscribe myself,

                           Ever, ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DXVIII.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                              _London, May 21, 1743._

_My very dear Brother B――――_,

LITTLE did I think, when I parted from you at _Bethesda_, that I should
be writing to you at this time in _London_. But GOD’s ways are in the
great waters, and his footsteps are not known. I have essayed to come
to you more than once, or twice; but I believe I can say, “the spirit
suffered me not.” In thought I am with you daily; when I shall come in
person, our Saviour only knows: perhaps, at an hour which neither you
nor I think of. You will see what I have wrote (though in much weakness)
to my dear Mr. _H――――_. The present weakness of my body will not suffer
me to enlarge much to you; though, was I to follow the inclination
of my soul, I should fill up many sheets. My dear brother, I love you
unfeignedly in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST, and heartily thank you for
all your works of faith, and the care you have taken of my dear family.
Surely our LORD sent you to _Bethesda_, and however cloudy the prospect
may have been for some time, I am persuaded a glorious sunshine will
succeed, and you shall yet see the salvation of our GOD. When our LORD
has any thing great to do, he is generally a great while bringing it
about, and many unaccountable dark providences generally intervene.
Thus it was with _Abraham_, _Jacob_, _Joseph_, _Moses_, and all the
eminent men of GOD in the days of old. Thus our LORD is pleased to
deal with me, and my affairs. Many precious promises have been given me
in respect to myself, my dear family, and the church of JESUS CHRIST,
which I am sure will be fulfilled in due time. I long to be with you,
to open our hearts freely, and to tell one another what our good GOD
has done for our souls. Great things has he done for me indeed, and
greater things is he yet doing, and about to do. The work of GOD is
likely to spread far and near, and such are daily added to the church
as shall be saved. I am employed every moment for the best of Masters,
and only lament that I can do no more. For some days, my body has been
much indisposed, but not so as to prevent my preaching. As my day is,
so is my strength; and as afflictions abound, consolations much more
abound. I know that this will lead you to give thanks on my behalf. I
am glad when I hear it goes well with you and yours. I am now like St.
_Paul_, who could have no rest, ’till he sent a brother to the church,
that he might enquire of their affairs, and know how they did. The
person that brings this, loves JESUS in sincerity, and I trust will be
a blessing to the house. I would have him employed among the children,
or as you and the brethren shall think fit. Our Saviour, I hope, will
direct you in every thing. As strength shall permit, I intend writing
to Mr. _J――――_. Blessed be GOD for raising up such dear friends. He
never can or will forsake those that put their trust in him. I hope
it is well with you and yours. I doubt not but your souls prosper.
Mr. _A――――_ writes to his mother, and tells her how you are instant in
season and out of season. Go on, my dear brother, thou man of GOD! and
may the LORD make you a spiritual father to thousands. That the LORD of
all lords may exceedingly bless you, is the earnest prayer of

                  Yours most affectionately in JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DXIX.


                            _To Mr. H――――._

                                              _London, May 31, 1743._

_My dear Mr. H――――, Friend and Brother_,

ALL last week, do what I would, I could not find freedom to write
a line, though I expected our dear brother _E――――_, the bearer of
this, to fail every hour. But now I know why he was detained, and I
restrained. This morning, to my unspeakable satisfaction, I saw a
letter from our dear brother _G――――_, dated _April_ 13th, wherein
he acquainted me of the welfare of the dear family, and of another
out-pouring of the spirit among you. O! my soul does magnify the LORD,
and my spirit rejoices in GOD my Saviour. After this, I expect to hear
of another shock: but I know you are the LORD’s, and he will take care
of your souls. As Mr. _E――――_ is going on board, I have not time to
say half I would. I fear I am sinfully impatient to see you. The time
will come by and by. Hasten it, O LORD, if it be thy blessed will! Our
Saviour does greater things for me every day. Last _Sunday_ morning, I
collected 23_l._ for the orphans in _Moor-fields_. It would amaze you
to see the great congregations, and wonderful presence of the LORD.
Grace! grace! I have paid all that is due in _England_, and have sent
you 25_l._ by the bearer. GOD willing, I shall remit you more soon.
Pray give my humble respects to dear Mr. _J――――_, and tell him, our
Saviour will enable me to pay him all soon with a thousand thanks. I
sent you 100_l._ by my brother’s ship, and a packet of letters. I hope
they came safe to hand. But I must have done. Salute my dear family,
and believe me to be, though now in great haste, dear man,

                              Ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER DXX.


                     _To Mr. G――――, of Carlisle._

                                              _London, June 9, 1743._

_My dear Brother_,

I Have been prevented by many things from writing to you. I now redeem
a few minutes to send you a line. I believe your way is clear to
_London_. The brethren, I am persuaded, will be willing to give you
the right-hand of fellowship, since you are determined not to meddle
with controversy, or to make _adult baptism_ a bone of contention;
but simply to preach JESUS CHRIST and him crucified. This I think is
the only way to propagate the gospel of the grace of GOD. Our Saviour
blesses me in it much, and owns and strengthens me more and more.
I have been very weak in body, but every day my strength hath been
renewed, and I have been enabled to mount on wings like an eagle. God
willing, I shall leave _London_ on _Monday_ next. If I should be out of
town, you will be kindly received. Glory be to GOD, the gospel spreads.
I feel myself the chief of sinners. As such, be pleased always to
remember to pray for, my dear brother,

              Yours most affectionately in JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DXXI.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                            _Burford, June 15, 1743._

_My dear Sir_,

I Cannot go any farther without writing you a line. Our Saviour
hath dealt most graciously with your unworthy friend. On _Monday_ I
experienced some sweet teachings from above, and was so happy, that I
thought our LORD was preparing me for some fresh trials. The prospect
pleased me much, knowing how all things had already worked together
for my good. Yesterday my body was very weary, but my soul happy, and I
preached at _Fairford_; this morning at _Glanfield_, and just now here.
It is dry ground; but the LORD has promised to pour water upon such.
He has richly watered my soul. Where I lay, was indeed a Bethel, a gate
of heaven. I hope GOD has been with you. My tender love to dear brother
_A――――s_. My fellow-travellers salute you. My love to the Tabernacle
people. Their prayers are heard. Grace! grace!

                         Yours affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DXXII.


                            _To the same._

                                         _Gloucester, June 18, 1743._

_My dear Friend_,

I Wrote to you from _Burford_ on _Wednesday_ last. My soul was then so
exceeding happy, that I want words to express it. Afterwards, we went
to _Bengeworth_, where we came about midnight, and were most heartily
received by Mr. _S――――_ and Mr. _O――――_. I was enabled to preach there
with such power, that all must confess, GOD was with us of a truth. We
dined very comfortably, and then set out for _Gloucester_, shouting,
Grace! grace! When I arrived, our Saviour was exceeding gracious; and
I had so much of heaven in my soul, that I wanted to lie down any where
to praise my GOD. I preached here early the next morning, then rode
to _Cheltenham_, and returned hither in the afternoon, and preached in
the evening. This morning I preached again, and received your second
welcome letter. I thank you for it. I could write much of the love
and abiding happiness I have in CHRIST: but I have many letters lying
unanswered before me. Adieu at present. The LORD be with you and yours.
Salute all the brethren. Forget not to pray for, my dear friend,

                           Ever, ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DXXIII.


                            _To the same._

                                         _Gloucester, June 21, 1743._

ON _Saturday_ I answered your two last letters. Our Saviour sent me
to _Gloucester_ for wise ends. Much substantial good has been done
to several of the society. My mouth and heart were greatly opened
in preaching. _Saturday_ evening was a time much to be remembered.
_Sunday_, was a great day of the Son of Man. I preached at _Gloucester_
in the morning, and near _Stroud_ in the evening. The word was clothed
with much power, both for sinners and saints. I think the congregation
at _Hampton_ was rather greater than ever. At night we had a precious
meeting in _Hampton-house_ garden; the house itself being too small to
hold the people without almost stifling them. The simplicity, sweetness,
and broken-heartedness of the poor souls would have melted your
heart. Indeed, much grace was upon them, and many, I believe, to their
unspeakable consolation, heard the voice of the LORD GOD in the trees
of the garden in the cool of the day. On _Monday_ morning I preached
again, and came away rejoicing. Whilst I was at _Hampton_, _J. C――――_
told me, how he and the people had been abused. My coming at this time,
I believe, has much strengthened the persecuted. Indeed there is a
glorious work in _Gloucestershire_. Brother _C――――_ is truly a great
soul! one of the weak things that GOD has chosen to confound the strong.
In my journey from _Hampton_ hither, our dear Master was graciously
with us. We have blessed news from _Scotland_. Brave news also from
_Pembrokeshire_. Surely the kingdom of the LORD and his CHRIST is
coming on apace. I know you say, “Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly.”

                           Ever, ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._


_P. S._ I must acquaint you, by way of postscript, of the following
anecdote of the old Mr. _Cole_, a most venerable dissenting minister;
whom I was always taught to ridicule, and (with shame I write it) used,
when a boy, to run into his meeting-house, and cry, _Old Cole! old
Cole! old Cole!_ Being asked once by one of his congregation, what
business I would be of? I said, “a minister, but I would take care
never to tell stories in the pulpit, like the old _Cole_.” About twelve
years afterwards, the old man heard me preach in one of the churches at
_Gloucester_; and on my telling some story to illustrate the subject I
was upon, having been informed what I had before said, made this remark
to one of his elders, “I find that young _Whitefield_ can now tell
stories, as well as old _Cole_.” Being affected much with my preaching,
he was as it were become young again, and used to say, when coming to
and returning from _Barn_, “These are days of the Son of Man indeed!”
nay, he was so animated, and so humbled, that he used to subscribe
himself _my Curate_, and went about preaching after me in the country,
from place to place. But one evening, whilst preaching, he was struck
with death, and then asked for a chair to lean on ’till he concluded
his sermon, when he was carried up stairs and died. O blessed GOD! if
it be thy holy will, may my exit be like his!




                             LETTER DXXIV.


                            _To the same._

                                         _Gloucester, June 27, 1743._

FULL of divine consolations, and at the same time, I trust, deeply
sensible of my own vileness, I have just arose from the throne of grace,
where I have been laying yours, my own, and the affairs of the whole
church, before our common Father and our GOD. He was pleased to give
me sweet access, and to assure me, that if he gave me his presence, he
would freely give me all things; but I must wait his time and season,
because that will be better for me. I have therefore just now put
my soul, as a blank, into the hands of JESUS CHRIST my Redeemer, and
desired him to write upon it what he pleases. I know it will be his
own image. Methinks I hear you say, Amen. I know you do from your
heart; for I believe you love me in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST, as I
do you, GOD knoweth. Our Saviour, by his wise providence has prevented
our receiving each others letters so soon as we expected. I preached
_Tuesday_ last in the evening at _Bristol_, and on _Wednesday_ twice;
and once at _Kingswood_.――On _Thursday_ in the morning I preached
there also, and afterwards went to _Bath_, where I was most cordially
received by Mr. _C――――_, and one Dr. _H――――_, a christian physician,
and Lady _C――――_. Here our Saviour gave me fresh hints, that if I would
stand still and wait his time and way, he would make even my enemies
to be at peace with me. I returned in the evening to _Bristol_, and
preached. I think it was this day the news came of his Majesty’s
fighting, and coming off conqueror. I had observed for some time past,
when praying for him, whether I would or not, out came this petition,
“LORD, cover thou his head in the day of battle.” Tho’ even while I was
praying, I wondered why I prayed so, not knowing that he was gone to
_Germany_ to fight. This gave me fresh confidence towards GOD. I spent
almost the whole day on _Friday_ in retirement, and prayer. My house
was made a Bethel to me indeed, the very gate of heaven. _Saturday_ I
preached again, and found in the day-time our Saviour had blessed my
endeavours to some souls. About three in the afternoon we set out for
_Wiltshire_. On _Sunday_ I preached at _Brinkworth_, on these words:
“Thy Maker is thy husband.” It was a day of espousals I believe to
many. GOD was with us of a truth. After sermon, I rode to _Longley_,
in company with many dear children of GOD, who attended me both on
horseback and on foot. We sung, and looked like persons that had been
at a spiritual wedding. The LORD helped me in preaching there also.
All was quiet. In the evening I preached at _Tetherton_, and a blessed
time it was. We rode like as the children of _Israel_ passing through
the enemies country. Afterwards we set out for _Hampton_, and reached
there about midnight. After having travelled about thirty miles, I yet
preached thrice. This morning I arose like a giant refreshed with wine,
and came hither about eleven. I found my mother recovered from her
illness, and my own soul filled and blessed in CHRIST. O grace! how
sweet is it? I am glad you are thirsting after an abiding in GOD, after
greater degrees of knowledge, both of yourself, and of JESUS CHRIST,
whom to know is life eternal. In order to this, you must expect many
trials, and well it is to be under the discipline of so tender a
Master. I know you will pray to the LORD to make and keep me humble.
I recommend you to his care, and wish you all the blessings of the
everlasting covenant, from

                                Yours,
                                                              _G. W._

I Wrote to you on _Saturday_, and on _Monday_ from _Gloucester_. I
suppose you have wrote to _Trevecka_. Words cannot express how good our
blessed Saviour has been to me, since I wrote last. I preached there on
_Monday_ night, and _Tuesday_ morning. The GOD of love filled my soul,
and enabled me to speak of his love with great power. Many felt it
also. On _Tuesday_ after morning sermon I went to _Abergavenny_; JESUS
was with me on the road; and we reached there about ten at night. On
_Wednesday_ I went to _Trevecka_, where I met with a whole troop of
JESU’s witnesses. I had some hours by myself, and shed many tears of
love before the LORD. At five in the evening, I preached to a larger
congregation than ever I had seen at _Trevecka_. JESUS was with us of a
truth, and I felt the power of that blood upon my own soul, which I was
recommending to others. After I had done, brother _H――――l D――――_ and
_R――――_ preached and prayed. The holy spirit came down, especially
when the latter preached, in a plentiful manner.――About eight we opened
the association with great solemnity. Our Saviour was much with me,
teaching and helping me to fill my place in a particular manner. The
brethren felt the same. About midnight we adjourned; but several of the
brethren sat up all night, and ushered in the morning with prayer and
praise. About eight we met again, and were greatly delighted at the
different and simple accounts the superintendents brought in of their
respective societies. Some of their accounts were very particular,
as to the state of the people’s souls; and several had gone off most
triumphantly to glory. We continued doing business ’till two in the
afternoon, and broke up with much solemnity and holy joy. Our Saviour
kept the new-wine ’till last, and gave us a sweet parting blessing. We
had great union with one another. Indeed, JESUS has done great things
for _Wales_. The work is much upon the advance. I was surprized to find
so much order. Brother _H―――― D――――_ has been blessed to the conversion
of a young clergyman, Rector of St. _B――――_, _London_. About five in
the evening I returned to _Abergavenny_, and preached there on _Friday_
morning, and afterwards set out for _Bristol_, where we arrived about
eight in the evening. My house, friends, &c. were made a great blessing
to the soul of,

                              Ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Madam_,

HAVING no time to answer your request concerning the _Hampton_ mob, I
herewith send you a letter, which I have just now received from my dear
fellow-labourer, who is the principal object of their fury. This young
confessor, some few years ago came out of curiosity to hear me, when
first I preached upon _Hampton Common_, in _Gloucestershire_. Being
converted himself, he found himself impelled to strengthen his brethren.
GOD has owned him much in _Hampton_, and the adjacent country, in
calling by him many poor sinners to the knowledge of the LORD JESUS

_Honoured and very dear Sir_,

BLESSED be the dear JESUS, he hath brought me safe hither. He was also
with me on the road, and I am persuaded, that whatsoever sufferings I
am to pass through here, all shall work together for good; for JESUS is
and will be with me. The mob has breathed out many threatenings against
me; but JESUS is greater than all, and I am persuaded he’ll let them
find him so. I rode all down the town without the least molestation,
only many cried, (but silently as it were) “O, he is come home!” which
was a surprizing thing to them; for a gentleman had affirmed, that
he saw me in prison. I have been walking up the town, without any
disturbance; but the mob, they say, continue more and more exasperated.
We expect them soon. They generally apprize one another, by ringing
a bell. The whole mob consist of about an hundred: but JESUS keeps me
without the least fear, and at the same time gives me quietly to wait
on him for direction, how to act. A few of the dear disciples are by me.
We have been praying together, and the LORD is with us. I believe death
in its ugliest shapes would not be terrible to some here, at least I
think so of myself; and when I look to the faithfulness of my Saviour,
I can loudly say, “As my day is, so my strength shall be.” Many of the
people of the town have been with me, to tell me the respect they have
for me, and how much they are concerned for the abuse that has been
given us. I believe all will be well by and by. At the same time, I
believe your coming might be much blessed to that end. I must conclude;
but I think to give you a farther account on _Monday_, if our Saviour
pleases. In the mean time, I heartily beg an interest in your prayers,
and the whole society with you. Tell them, O tell them, to get ready
for suffering, by cleaving close to the Lamb, rooted and grounded in
him: withal please to give my kind love and service to them for JESU’s
sake, and be pleased to accept the same your dear self, and many thanks
for all the tokens of unfeigned love conferred on

                  Your unworthy brother and servant,
                                                              _T. A._

_My dear Madam_,

NOT doubting but you wait with impatience for dear Mr. _A――――_’s
promised second letter, after having just read it once over, I herein
inclose it; having only time to beg the continuance of your prayers,
and to desire you to send this with the former, as soon as possible, to

                              Yours, &c.,
                                                              _G. W._


                                                     _July 11, 1743._

_Honoured Sir_,

I Promised in my last to write to you again, and to let you know more
particularly of our persecutions, which are as follow. On _Saturday_
after I wrote to you, I met the society, and after we had sung an hymn,
came brother _I――――_, with my dear wife from _Bristol_. They came into
the society and sat down, while I exhorted them to stedfastness and
patience under the cross. They seemed much strengthened, and ready
for any suffering; for GOD was with us. After that, I desired brother
_I――――_ to pray, which he did. After that I prayed in faith, and was
enabled to plead CHRIST’s promises to his church; though we are but a
little branch. I had not prayed long, but many of us were persuaded,
he would never leave or forsake us. In every prayer we asked direction
how to act. I was persuaded, the only way to still the mob, was, not
to resist or fly from them, but to give myself up wholly to them, and
let them do all that the LORD should permit: for the more we had drawn
back, the more our adversaries rejoiced, and vowed they would and
should put an end to preaching in _Hampton_. The mob, which consisted
of near an hundred, were now about the house, making a terrible noise,
and swearing prodigiously. I went down to them and opened the door, and
asking them what they wanted. I told them, if they wanted my life, I
was willing to deliver it up for JESUS’s sake; but withal I desired to
know, why they either disturbed me or sought my life? For I did not
know I had given them any just cause for either. Some of them said,
I had, by bringing in false doctrine, and impoverishing the poor. I
told them, that they could prove neither, and that it was really false.
They seemed something at a stand; when about five of them begun to be
more exasperated, and took me, in order to throw me into a lime pit. I
told them, they need not force me, for I was willing to suffer, though
unjustly, for JESUS’s sake. But while they were pushing me along,
some neighbours took me in their arms and carried me into one of their
houses; so I was delivered out of their hands. On sabbath-day morning
about twenty of the society met again. We spent the morning in prayer.
In the evening I preached, and had uncommon strength and courage given
me from the LORD, so that death in its ugliest shapes did not at all
terrify me. About five in the afternoon we met in my house. I first
exhorted them to keep their minds close to the LORD, and if the mob
came, not at all to resist, but to make way for them to come to me,
and let them do what the LORD would permit. I then prayed and sung that
hymn, “_Our lives, our blood, &c._” When we had so done, in came the
mob, demanding me to come down. I asked, by what authority they did so?
They swore they would have me. Then said I, so you shall. So they took
me to the lime pit, and threw me in. But O what a power of GOD fell on
my soul! I thought, with _Stephen_, the heavens opened to my sight, and
the LORD JESUS was ready, if I had died, to receive me. I believe my
undaunted courage shook some. I told them, I should meet them at the
judgment, and then their faces would gather paleness. They let me out,
and I came home and kneeled down with the people that were there, and
prayed to, and praised GOD. After that, I exhorted from the three first
verses of the third chapter of the first epistle of _John_. And when
I was just concluding, in came the mob again, and took me to a brook
to throw me in there. One, who was a persecutor but a few days before,
endeavoured to hinder them; but they took me away, and led me all
up the town. I had a sweet walk, and talked and reasoned with the
persecutors all the way. My heart was full of love. Before I had gone
far, all but one agreed to let me go back again, but he insisted upon
my going. I told them, the law was open against them, nevertheless I
was willing to suffer any thing for CHRIST. Then they told me, if I
would forbear preaching but for a month, they would let me go; I told
them, I would make no such promise. So forward I went. One of them
threw me in, and I went to the bottom, but I came up again, with my
hands clasped together. I did not desire to come out, till they fetched
me. Accordingly, in jumped one or two of them and took me out; but then
one maliciously and cowardly pushed me in again, and much bruised and
cut one of my legs against a stone. Some of the others were going to
throw him in for so doing. I came home talking to them. Many seemed
to repent of what they had done, and promised to molest me no more. I
believe, GOD has smote some of their consciences. One who was the chief,
and would not agree that I should go back, I hear by several, he says
he will in no wise touch me again. Many advise us to prosecute them;
but if they are quiet, I am content, and can say from my heart, “Father,
forgive them.” I should be glad if you would be here next _Sunday_. In
the mean time pray for me, who am,

                  Your unworthy brother and servant,
                                                              _T. A._

_Dear Friend_,

I Have been so employed for some time past in preaching and travelling,
that I could not possibly correspond with you or others as usual;
but you see where I am; I came here to preach at the fair; because
people from all parts flock hither at that season. Yesterday I preached
four times, and twice statedly every day. O that sinners may be made
willing to come and buy of CHRIST’s wine, and of CHRIST’s milk, without
money and without price! Last night was such a time as I never saw
in _Bristol_ society before. To-morrow, GOD willing, I set out for
_Hampton_, to see what can be done for the poor persecuted sheep of
CHRIST there. I hear I am threatened, but JESUS will stand by me. In
what manner, expect to hear again soon, from

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DXXIX.

                                            _Hampton, July 25, 1743._

_My dear Friend_,

ON _Thursday_ I came here, and expected to be attacked; because I
had heard, that the mob which had been so outragious towards you and
others for so long time, had now threatened, that if ever I came there
again, they would have a piece of my black gown to make aprons with. No
sooner had I entered the town, but I saw and heard the signals, such as
blowing of horns, and ringing of bells for gathering the mob. My soul
was kept quite easy. I preached in a large grass plat from these words,
“And seeing the grace of GOD, he exhorted them with full purpose of
heart to cleave unto the LORD;” and as it happened, I finished my
sermon and pronounced the blessing, just as the ring-leader of the mob
broke in upon us, which I soon perceived disappointed and grieved them
very much. One of them, as I was coming down from the table, called me
_coward_; but I told him, they should hear from me another way. I then
went into the house, and preached upon the stair case to a large number
of serious souls; but these real troublers of _Israel_ soon came in
to mock and mob us. But feeling what I never felt before, as you know
I have very little natural courage, strength and power being given us
from above, I leaped down stairs, and all ran away before me. However
they continued making a noise about the house till midnight, abusing
the poor people as they went home, and as we hear they broke one young
lady’s arm in two places. Brother _A――――_ they threw a second time into
the pool, in which operation he received a deep wound in his leg. _John
C――――_’s life, that second _Bunyan_, was much threatened.――Young _W――――
H――――_ they wheeled in a barrow to the pool’s side, lamed his brother,
and grievously hurt several others. Hearing that two or three clergymen
were in the town, one of whom was a justice of the peace, I went to
them; but alas! I seemed unto them as one that mocked, and instead of
redressing, they laid the cause of all the grievances at my door; but,
by the help of my GOD, I shall still persist in preaching myself, and
in encouraging those (as I know no law of GOD or man against it) who
I believe are truly moved by the Holy Ghost. As I came out from the
clergymen, two of the unhappy mobbers were particularly insolent, and
huzza’d us out of town. “Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad,” for
now I humbly hope, I begin to be a disciple of JESUS CHRIST; since to
suffer for, as well as to believe and preach his precious truths, and
own his despis’d people, is now given to,

_My dear Friend_,

ON _Friday_ night I reached _Gloucester_, where I received your kind
and animating letter. On _Saturday_ I came hither. Yesterday was an
high day: I preached four times in the fields, and the congregations
were as large as at the beginning: blessed seasons indeed! Here are
people from all quarters. I am just going out to preach again, and
therefore can only add, that perhaps I may set out for _Exeter_ on
_Wednesday_, from whence you may expect to hear again, from

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DXXXI.

                                             _Exeter, July 31, 1743._

_Dear Sir_,

WE came hither in safety last night. Upon the road my soul was sweetly
humbled before GOD, who hath given me near access to his throne. Good
Mr. _K――――_, our host, and his yoke-fellow, seem to be _Israelites_
indeed. In all probability an effectual door will be opened for
preaching the everlasting gospel. I am to begin this evening. Brethren,
pray for us. I sleep but little; inward comforts support and strengthen
both soul and body. Join me in crying, Grace! grace! In great haste and
greater affection, I subscribe myself,

                         Yours affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DXXXII.

                                                _Exon, Aug. 2, 1743._

_My dear Man_,

I Wrote unto you on _Saturday_, and preached the same evening to a
great body of people. Several of the clergy attended, with whom this
city abounds. Some went off, others staid ’till I had done. All was
quiet, and our LORD soon made way for himself into the people’s hearts.
Yesterday evening I preached on _Southean-hay_ to upwards of ten
thousand; ’twas just like a _Moor-fields_ congregation. GOD was with us
of a truth. The people were very desirous of my longer continuance here;
but so many things concurred to call me to _London_, that after close
application to the throne of grace, and consultation with my friends, I
am determined, GOD willing, to leave _Exeter_ to-morrow morning, and to
preach with Mr. _D――――_ in my way to town. I find I am in my element,
when evangelizing. Our Saviour fills my heart with his presence, and
has in a particular manner prepared the people’s hearts in the _West_
for receiving the gospel-message. He keeps me happy and chearful amidst
all my various trials, for which I pray you to join in thanksgiving with

                     Your affectionate friend, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DXXXIII.


                    _To Mr. H――――, at Gloucester._

                                             _London, Aug. 20, 1743._

_My dear Mr. H――――_,

HOW wonderfully does our all-wise Redeemer order things for the trial
of his children! Alas! alas! how apt are they to judge, censure, and be
needlessly prejudiced against each other. Being weak in body, and under
great concern of mind upon several accounts, I desired dear Mr. _G――――_
to acquaint you, that in our last association we agreed not to separate
from the established church, but go on in our usual way. Indeed, the
motion to separate, was only made by a very few of more contracted
principles. By far the greater part most strenuously opposed it, and
with good reason; for as we enjoy such great liberty under the mild
and gentle government of his present Majesty king _George_, we think
we can do him, our country, and the cause of GOD, more service in
ranging up and down, preaching repentance towards GOD and faith in our
LORD JESUS, to those multitudes who would neither come into church or
meeting, but who are led by curiosity to follow us into the fields.
However disorderly this may seem to bigots of every denomination, yet
it is a way to which GOD has affixed his seal for many years past,
and therefore we have no reason to turn to the right hand or to the
left, but to press forwards and to do our utmost towards enlarging the
kingdom of our LORD JESUS; not doubting, but when we come to stand at
his bar, we shall be received with as equal an _Euge-bone_ as those,
who thro’ prejudice, or want of better information, censure us as going
beyond our line. That this may be our happy case, you will join in
praying with

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                                             _London, Sept. 2, 1743._

_Dear Madam_,

A Thousand thanks for your kind solicitude concerning me and mine. My
wife has been in trying circumstances, partly through the unskilfulness
of a chaise-driver, I mean myself. Being advised to take her out into
the air, I drove her as well as myself, through in advertence, into a
ditch. Finding that we were falling, she put her hand cross the chaise,
and thereby preserved us both from being thrown out. The ditch might be
about 14 feet deep, but blessed be GOD, though all that saw us falling,
cried out, they are killed, yet, through infinite mercy, we received
no great hurt. The place was very narrow near the bottom, and yet the
horse went down, as tho’ let down by a pulley. A stander-by ran down
and catched hold of its head, to prevent its going forwards. I got
upon its back and was drawn out by a long whip; whilst my wife hanging
between the chaise and the bank, was pulled up on the other side by two
or three kind assistants. Being both in a comfortable frame, I must own,
to my shame, that I felt rather regret than thankfulness in escaping
what I thought would be a kind of a translation, to our wished-for
haven. But O amazing love! we were so strengthened, that the chaise
and horse being taken up, and our bruises being washed with vinegar
in a neighbouring house, we went on our intended way, and came home
rejoicing in GOD our Saviour. Not expecting my wife’s delivery for
some time, I intend making a short excursion, and then you may expect
further news from

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Madam_,

MY last left me just entering upon another short excursion. Blessed
be GOD, it was pleasant because it was profitable to my own, and I
trust to many other souls. The last evening of it, I preached from a
balcony to many thousands, who stood in the street as comfortable as at
noon-day. Upon retiring to my lodgings, news was brought me, that GOD
had given me a son. This hastened me up to _London_, where I now am,
and from whence after I have baptized my little one, GOD willing, I
purpose to set out again on my Master’s public business. You will not
fail to pray, that I may be taught how to order the child aright, and
thereby add to the many obligations already laid on, dear Madam,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                                     _Avon, Wilts, October 15, 1743._

_My dear Friend_,

I Must not be long from _London_ without writing to you. Our Saviour
brought me hither last night, and filled me as with new wine. I purpose
staying till _Monday_; if you write, direct for me at _Bristol_. I
trust our LORD hath much people here. This leaves me in spirit sitting
at his feet. Praying this may find you there, I am

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DXXXVII.


                            _To the Same._

                                         _Cullompton, Oct. 25, 1743._

I Wrote to you on the 15th instant, at _Avon_. In the morning I walked
to _Tetherton_, and preached there with much of the divine presence,
and to the abundant satisfaction and comfort of GOD’s people. After
sermon, I baptized four boys, each about three months old, as near
as I can remember. The ordinance was so solemn and awful that Mrs.
_G――――_ (who you know is a quaker) had a mind immediately to partake
of it. When I go to _Wiltshire_, I believe I shall baptize her and her
children, with some adult persons that have tasted of redeeming love.
About one o’clock I preached at _Clack_ in the street. All was quiet.
I then rode to _Brinkworth_, and was enabled to preach there with still
greater freedom, and afterwards administred the Holy Sacrament to about
two hundred and fifty communicants. Our LORD made himself known to many
in breaking of bread. Some strangers, that came from _Bath_, went home
filled with our Redeemer’s presence. I have preached at _Chippenham_.
I hope I managed all things right about the affair of the _Hampton_
rioters. It seems, they have compelled us to appeal unto _Cæsar_.
Evidences shall be examined in the country, time enough to send their
examinations up to town. We had a wonderful time in _Wiltshire_. On
_Saturday_ last, when I came to _Wellington_, the Reverend Mr. _D――――_
persuaded me to stay there, because the country people had come from
all quarters several times to hear me, and had been disappointed. I
consented, and preached in his meeting-house in the evening to a large
auditory. The Reverend Mr. _F――――t_, formerly pupil to doctor _D――――_,
came there, and staid all night. The blessed JESUS gave us much freedom
in conversation. I hope both will be instruments under GOD in promoting
a good work in these parts. _Sunday_ morning I preached again in the
meeting-house, and in the evening to seven thousand in the fields.
On _Monday_ about ten in the morning, and in the afternoon about two,
I preached at _Cullompton_ with much freedom and power; was kindly
received, met some reputable dissenters, and am now setting out for
_Exeter_ with dear Mr. _K――――_, who came here to meet my dear friend.

I Have strong conviction that our LORD intends doing something in the
west. Since my arrival here, letters of invitation have come from many
parts. I thank you for your kind sympathy under the many trials, with
which I have been surrounded and exercised. I find there is a needs-be
for all; for by our being acquainted with the enemy’s work in our own
hearts, we see how he works on others, and are enabled to speak better
to their hearts. “Whether we are afflicted (says the apostle,) or
whether we are comforted, it is for your sake.” Besides, by temptation
we are kept from sinking into formality, and consequently are taught
better to handle our spiritual weapons, and discover what is amiss
both in heart and life. For this cause, we are commanded to rejoice
when we fall into divers temptations. I thank GOD for giving you some
experience of these things. We must now all be _Calebs_; all heart, but
at the same time, all humility. Feeling we can do nothing of ourselves,
yet believing we can do all things through CHRIST strengthening us.
Blessed be his Name, the common people begin to feel. I preached
between two and three this afternoon on _Southern-hay_, and expounded
in the evening at Mr. _K――――_’s. Even some of the polite were much
affected last night; and this morning, O what a blessed season had
we! I believe I shall think it my duty to stay in these parts for some
time. Continue to pray for me, and assure yourself that you are never
forgotten by

                              Yours, &c.

ALL being hushed and solemn around me, and my soul filled with the
peace of GOD that passeth all understanding, I now sit down to give
you a further account of my feeble labours. On _Monday_ last I went to
_Axminster_, and preached to about two thousand without, and afterward
exhorted within the house, where I lay. The next day I preached to a
greater number of people, and with more freedom. I gave an exhortation
at night, and met the society. Our LORD vouchsafed us a gracious
blessing. On _Wednesday_ I went to _Ottery_, but just as I named my
text, the bells rang. Upon this I adjourned to a field, whither the
people ran in droves.――As I stepped into the inn, before I went into
the field, a clergyman came, who asked me by what authority I preached,
said it was a riot, and that the meeting was illegal. I answered him as
I thought pertinently, and afterwards went and shewed him my authority,
by preaching on these words: “Go ye to all the world, and preach
the gospel to every creature.” Between six and seven in the evening,
I returned to _Exeter_, where some hundreds were waiting to hear
me expound. The LORD was with us. The LORD makes this place very
comfortable to me. Prejudices fall off daily, and people begin not
only rationally to discern, but powerfully to feel the doctrines of the
gospel. To-morrow, GOD willing, I go with Mr. _K――――_ to _Biddeford_.
From thence expect to hear again from

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._


_Postscript._ _Ten at night._――It would have pleased you to have been
here this evening. I question, whether near a third part of _Exeter_
were not attending on the word preached. All was solemn and awful,
and the LORD gave me much assistance from his holy spirit. Help me to
praise him. Adieu! Good night! The LORD be with you.

_Dear Madam_,

I Thank you for your kind caution to spare myself; but evangelizing
is certainly my province. Every where effectual doors are opened,
and great freedom is given to me both in public preaching and private
conversation. Many are blessed by both. The Rev. Mr. _J―――― N――――_,
rector of _St. Gennis, Cornwall_, is here. GOD willing, I’ll go with
him on _Saturday_. Here is also another clergyman about eighty years of
age, but not above one year old in the school and knowledge of CHRIST.
He lately preached three times and rode forty miles the same day.
The dissenting minister and his wife were very hearty, and perhaps
here is one of the most settled female christian societies in the
kingdom. I cannot well describe with what power the word was attended.
Yesterday in the afternoon, and in the evening, it was just like as at
_Edinburgh_. The old clergyman was much broken. A young _Oxonian_, who
came with him, and many others, were most deeply affected. I suppose
there were upwards of two thousand in the evening in the Meeting-house.
Dear Mr. _H――――y_, one of our first Methodists at _Oxford_, and who was
lately a curate here, had laid the blessed foundation. So far therefore
from thinking of nestling at _London_, that I am more and more
convinced that I should go from place to place, and therefore question
if I shall see _London_ for some time. If not too angry with me for
prosecuting this rambling way of life, be pleased to pray for, dear
madam,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._


_Postscript._ _Seven at night._ To-day hath been as yesterday, and much
more abundant. I am here, as in _Scotland_ and _♦New-England_. Praise
to free grace! Here is work enough for some months. The weather is very
favourable; range, therefore, I must and will.

_Dear Madam_,

GLAD I am that GOD inclined my heart to come hither. He hath been with
us of a truth. How did his stately steps appear in the sanctuary last
LORD’s-day? Many, many prayers were put up by the worthy Rector, and
others, for an out-pouring of GOD’s blessed spirit. They were answered.
Arrows of conviction fled so thick and so fast, and such an universal
weeping prevailed from one end of the congregation to the other, that
good Mr. _J――――_ could not help going from seat to seat to speak,
encourage, and comfort the wounded souls. The _Oxonian_’s father was
almost struck dumb; and the young _Oxonian_’s crest was so lowered,
that I believe he’ll never venture to preach an unknown CHRIST, or
deal in the false commerce of unfelt truths. I could enlarge, but I
must away to _Biddeford_, just to give satan another stroke, and bid
my christian friends farewel, and then return the way I came, namely
through _Exeter_, _Wellington_ and _Bristol_, to the great metropolis:
but journeying, and various other matters that lie before me, I expect
will prevent your hearing so frequently as usual, from

_My dear Friend_,

’TIS past eleven at night, but lest I should not have time to-morrow
at _Gloucester_, which I intend to take in my way to _Birmingham_, I’ll
rob myself of a little sleep to write to you now. On _Friday_ evening
we reached five miles beyond _Reading_. Last night about nine we got
to _Clack_. It rained and snowed much for about seven miles, and the
way was dangerous; but the blessed JESUS kept us in safety. In the
morning I preached and gave the sacrament at _Tetherton_. This evening
I preached here. They were good times. I have a cold, but our LORD
warms my heart. To-morrow I must away to _Gloucester_. O follow, follow
with your prayers.

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

WANT of time, not of love, prevented my writing to you from
_Gloucester_. Neither have I now leisure to be very particular. It is
near eleven at night, and nature calls for rest. I have preached five
times this day, and, weak as I am, through CHRIST strengthening me,
I could preach five times more. I think I was scarce ever so happy
before. Surprizing! how the LORD JESUS hath made way for me in these
parts. I lose nothing by being quiet and leaving all to him. O was you
here, what could I not tell you? The weather is just like Spring. That
the day-spring from on high may visit your heart, till you rise to
eternal perfect day, earnestly prays

                              Yours, &c.

_My dear Friend_,

WHAT do you think? Since my last, I have stole a whole day to dispatch
some private business: however, in the evening I expounded to a great
room full of people, who would rush into my lodgings, whether I would
or not. On _Sunday_ morning at eight I preached in the street to about
a thousand, with much freedom. I then went to church and received the
sacrament, and afterwards preached to several thousands in the street.
The hearers seemed much pleased and delighted. It happened by the
providence of GOD, that no minister would come to preach at a house at
_Wedgbury_, where a weekly lecture used to be kept up: I was therefore
earnestly entreated to come. I went, after my afternoon’s preaching at
_Birmingham_, and preached there at six in the evening to many hundreds
in the street. It is about six miles from _Birmingham_. The word came
with power, and only one or two made a noise at a distance. Afterwards
we had a precious meeting in private. The power of the dear Redeemer
was much amongst us. The person with whom I lodged was a widow fearing
GOD. Her husband was an eminent saint, and had been refreshed by my
writings, particularly my journals, as had many others that I met
with. On _Monday_ morning about eight I preached to a large company
in a field. By eleven I returned to _Birmingham_, and preached to many
thousands on a Common near the town. The soldiers were exercising;
but the officers hearing that I was coming to preach, dismissed them,
and promised that no disturbance should be made. All was quiet, and
a blessed time we had. In the afternoon about three I preached again
to about the same company, with the same success. Then I rode to
_Wedgbury_ and preached there, and afterwards exhorted: but I cannot
well tell you, what a sweet melting time there was. Many were in tears.
About one I went to bed exceeding happy. In the morning I broke up some
fallow ground at a place called _Mare-Green_, about two miles from
_Wedgbury_. Much mobbing had been there against Mr. _Wesley_’s friends.
A few poor souls began to insult me, but JESUS strengthened me much.
Several clods were thrown, one of them fell on my head, and another
struck my fingers, while I was in prayer. A sweet gospel spirit was
given to me. I preached again at _Birmingham_ to larger auditories
than before, about eleven the same morning and three in the afternoon.
In the evening I expounded twice in a large room. Once to the rich,
and once to the poor, and went to rest happier than the night before.
In the morning I took my leave of the _Birmingham_ people, who wept
much and were indeed deeply affected, and shewed great concern at
my departure. I then went to _Kidderminster_, about twelve miles
from _Birmingham_, where I was kindly received by Mr. _W――――ms_, with
whom I have corresponded for near two years. Many friends were at his
house. I was greatly refreshed to find what a sweet savour of good Mr.
_Baxter_’s doctrine, works and discipline remained to this day.

              _The sweet remembrance of the just,_
              _Shall flourish when he sleeps in dust._

I preached about three in the afternoon to a large auditory near the
church. Some unkind men, though they promised not to do so, rang the
bells; but our Saviour enabled me to preach with power. In the evening
and next morning I preached in the meeting house. I then went with Mr.
_W――――_ to _Bromsgrove_, about seven miles from _Kidderminster_, and
was kindly received by one Mr. _K――――y_, a good man, and several others,
among whom were two or three Baptist and one Independent ministers.
About three in the afternoon I preached in a field. Some rude people
kicked a football and sounded a horn at some distance, but the LORD
enabled me to preach with boldness. About six I preached in the Baptist
Meeting-house, left _Kidderminster_ at eight, and reached _Worcester_
about ten at night. Mr. _W――――ms_ and another friend accompanied
us. In the morning the good old Mr. _S――――y_, who was supposed to be
sanctified from the womb, came to us while we baited. In the evening
I reached _Gloucester_, very thankful for my week’s progress, and
rejoicing greatly in CHRIST for giving me such a delightful and happy
Christmas. This day I have preached twice here, and have been enabled
to dispatch some private affairs. It is now near twelve. My dear friend,
I wish you an exceeding happy new year. This time twelve-month I was
writing to you from _Bristol_. O what has the dear LORD JESUS done
for me since that, and since I was born! And O what does he intend
to do for me before I die, and when time shall be no more? I am lost
in wonder! I must away and cry Grace! grace! Praying that you may be
filled with all the fulness of GOD, I subscribe, my dearest friend,

                        Ever, ever yours whilst
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Mr. H――――_,

IT being wet and dark, we thought it prudent to stay here this night.
I cannot employ part of the evening better than in writing to you,
and blessed be our GOD, I can send you good news. Our gracious LORD
was with me at _Pitchcomb_ and _Hampton_. We have had a wonderful
sweet association in _Wales_, with much of the Redeemer’s presence,
especially when I began to speak about the law affair. The brethren
were very generous, according to their circumstances, and one
gentlewoman sent me five pounds. After mature deliberation, we
determined to prosecute the affair to the utmost, and to set apart
next _Tuesday_ fortnight (the first day of the term) for a day of
fasting and prayer, and to make collections for that purpose. The cause
is the LORD’s, and much depends on our getting the victory. I believe
we shall. I have had a favourable answer from Colonel _S――――_, and
also from Colonel _Gar――――_. Hitherto the LORD prospers us. I am now
going to _London_ very happy, and in some measure thankful for the
many blessings I have received. Help me, my dear friend, to cry Grace!
grace! Inclosed you have some letters: be pleased to peruse and deliver
them. I bless GOD that affairs have taken such a turn. I have been at
_Abergavenny_, and am settled as to my dear wife’s coming down. Blessed
be GOD, she and the little one are pretty well. I shall be glad to hear
from you when I come to _London_. I hope our LORD blesses you, both in
body and soul, and shews you the way wherein you should go. That you
may be continually guided by his counsel, and after death conducted to
his glory, is the hearty prayer of, dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

                                             _London, Jan. 18, 1744._

THIS afternoon I received your kind letter, and thank you a thousand
times for your great generosity in lending me some furniture, having
little of my own. I know who will repay you. Next week, GOD willing,
my dear wife and little one will come to _Gloucester_, for I find it
beyond my circumstances to maintain them here. I leave _London_, GOD
willing, this day sev’nnight. Your affairs and concerns are mine. I
shall lay them before our common Lord. My brother will receive a letter
about my wife’s coming. She and the little one are brave and well. But
why talk I of wife and little one? Let all be absorbed in the thoughts
of the love, sufferings, free and full salvation of the infinitely
great and glorious _Emmanuel_. Blessed, for ever blessed be his holy
Name, for such happy beginnings of another year! How would it rejoice
you to see the many thousands in this metropolis, like new-born
babes, desiring to be fed with the sincere milk of the word, that they
may grow thereby. This, if I know any thing of my heart, is all my
salvation, and all my desire. In respect to other things, at present
I know this is, and I trust always will be the habitual language of my
heart: O blessed GOD,

              _Thy gifts, if call’d for, I resign,_
              _Pleas’d to receive, pleas’d to restore;_
              _Gifts are thy work; it shall be mine,_
              _The giver only to adore._

That both of us may be always kept thus minded, is the earnest prayer
of

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._

                                          _Gloucester, Feb. 9, 1744._

_My dear Friend_,

WHO knows what a day may bring forth? Last night I was called to
sacrifice my _Isaac_; I mean to bury my only child and son about four
months old. Many things occurred to make me believe he was not only
to be continued to me, but to be a preacher of the everlasting gospel.
Pleased with the thought, and ambitious of having a son of my own,
so divinely employed, satan was permitted to give me some wrong
impressions, whereby, as I now find, I misapplied several texts of
scripture. Upon these grounds I made no scruple of declaring, “that
I should have a son, and that his name was to be _John_.” I mentioned
the very time of his birth, and fondly hoped, that he was to be
great in the sight of the LORD. Every thing happened according to
the predictions, and my wife having had several narrow escapes while
pregnant, especially by her falling from a high horse, and my driving
her into a deep ditch in a one-horse chaise a little before the time of
her lying-in, and from which we received little or no hurt, confirmed
me in my expectation, that GOD would grant me my heart’s desire. I
would observe to you, that the child was even born in a room, which the
master of the house had prepared as a prison for his wife for coming
to hear me. With joy would she often look upon the bars and staples and
chains which were fixed in order to keep her in. About a week after his
birth, I publickly baptized him in the Tabernacle, and in the company
of thousands solemnly gave him up to that GOD, who gave him to me. A
hymn, too fondly composed by an aged widow, as suitable to the occasion,
was sung, and all went away big with hopes of the child’s being
hereafter to be employed in the work of GOD; but how soon are all their
fond, and as the event hath proved, their ill-grounded expectations
blasted, as well as mine. House-keeping being expensive in _London_, I
thought best to send both parent and child to _Abergavenny_, where my
wife had a little house of my own, the furniture of which, as I thought
of soon embarking for _Georgia_, I had partly sold, and partly given
away. In their journey thither, they stopped at _Gloucester_ at the
_Bell-Inn_, which my brother now keeps, and in which I was born. There,
my beloved was cut off with a stroke. Upon my coming here, without
knowing what had happened, I enquired concerning the welfare of parent
and child; and by the answer, found that the flower was cut down.
I immediately called all to join in prayer, in which I blessed the
Father of mercies for giving me a son, continuing it to me so long, and
taking it from me so soon. All joined in desiring that I would decline
preaching ’till the child was buried; but I remembered a saying of
good Mr. _Henry_, “that weeping must not hinder sowing,” and therefore
preached twice the next day, and also the day following; on the evening
of which, just as I was closing my sermon, the bell struck out for the
funeral. At first, I must acknowledge, it gave nature a little shake,
but looking up I recovered strength, and then concluded with saying,
that this text on which I had been preaching, namely, “all things
worked together for good to them that love GOD,” made me as willing to
go out to my son’s funeral, as to hear of his birth. Our parting from
him was solemn. We kneeled down, prayed, and shed many tears, but I
hope tears of resignation: And then, as he died in the house wherein
I was born, he was taken and laid in the church where I was baptized,
first communicated, and first preached. All this you may easily
guess threw me into very solemn and deep reflection, and I hope deep
humiliation; but I was comforted from that passage in the book of
Kings, where is recorded the death of the _Shunamite_’s child, which
the Prophet said, “The LORD had hid from him;” and the woman’s answer
likewise to the Prophet when he asked, “Is it well with thee? Is it
well with thy husband? Is it well with thy child?” And she answered,
“_It is well._” This gave me no small satisfaction. I immediately
preached upon the text the day following at _Gloucester_, and then
hastened up to _London_, preached upon the same there; and though
disappointed of a living preacher by the death of my son; yet I hope
what happened before his birth, and since at his death, hath taught
me such lessons, as, if duly improved, may render his mistaken parent
more cautious, more sober-minded, more experienced in satan’s devices,
and consequently more useful in his future labours to the church of
GOD. Thus, “out of the eater comes forth meat, and out of the strong

_My dear dear Mr. H――――_,

MULTIPLICITY of urgent affairs has kept me from answering your kind
letter sooner. Blessed be GOD for giving you such a prosperous journey.
I am not sorry that some, after their much joy, have been brought down
and plunged into much misery. It is no more than might be expected.
Stolen sweets prepare for bitter tears. On _Monday_ morning I shall
know what the rioters intend doing. There has been dreadful work near
_Birmingham_, but satan will be overthrown. We had a glorious fast
on _Monday_, and collected above sixty pounds for our poor suffering
brethren. We have had two solemn funerals. I hope the work prospers
in your hands. Our lawyer hath sent me word, that the rioters stand
trial.――I think, GOD willing, to be in _Gloucestershire_ by _Monday_
sev’nnight. The LORD be with you. I salute all, and am, my dear Mr.
_H――――_,

          Your most affectionate, though unworthy friend and
                            ready servant,
                                                              _G. W._

_P. S._ Since I wrote the above, I have consulted with friends, and
find it best to come through _Gloucester_ to _Abergavenny_.――GOD
willing, I hope to preach with you on _Tuesday_ between seven and eight
at night. Be pleased immediately on the receipt of this to send word to
brother _Adams_ to meet me without fail at _Gloucester_ on _Tuesday_,
to confer about our assize affair. I heard yesterday from _Wales_. I
bought a second-hand suit of curtains to-day, so you need not send any
thing to _Abergavenny_. “Poor, yet making others rich,” shall be my
motto still.




                             LETTER DXLIX.


                                            _London, March 12, 1744._

_My dear Friend_,

THIS leaves me just returned from _Gloucester_ assizes, where it has
pleased the great Judge of quick and dead to give us the victory over
the _Hampton_ rioters. You remember I informed you, that I thought we
should be obliged to appeal unto _Cæsar_. A solemn day of fasting and
humiliation was kept on that account; and accordingly last term we
lodged an information against them in the _King’s-Bench_. Matters of
fact being proved by a variety of evidence, and the defendants making
no reply, the rule was made absolute, and an information filed against
them. To this they pleaded _Not guilty_, and therefore, according to
the method of the Crown-office, the cause was referred to the assizes
held in _Gloucester_ the third instant. Our council opened the cause
by informing the court, that rioters were not to be reformers, and that
his Majesty had no where put the reins of government into the hands of
mobbers, nor made them either judge or jury. One of them in particular,
the _Recorder of Oxford_, with great gravity, reminded the gentlemen on
the jury of the advice of _Gamaliel_, “Refrain from these men and let
them alone, for if this council, or this work be of man, it will come
to nought; but if it be of GOD, ye cannot overthrow it, least haply ye
be found even to fight against GOD.” Our witnesses were then called.
Mr. _Adams_ and four more, three of which were not reputed Methodists,
so clearly proved both the riot and the facts, that the judge was of
opinion, there needed no other evidence. The council for the defendants
then rose up, and displayed a good deal of oratory, and I think said
all that could be said to mend a bad matter. One urged, “that we were
enthusiasts, and our principles and practices had such a tendency to
infect and hurt the people, that it was right, in his opinion, for
any private person to stand up and put a stop to us; and whoever did
so, was a friend to his country.” He strove to influence the jury, by
telling them, “That if a verdict was given against the defendants, it
would cost them two hundred pounds; that the defendants rioting was not
premeditated, but that coming to hear Mr. _A――――_, and being offended
at his doctrine, a sudden quarrel arose, and thereby the unhappy
men were led into the present fray, which he could have wished had
not happened; but however, it did not amount to a riot, but only an
assault.” Their other council informed the jury, “That they would
undertake to prove, that the Methodists began the tumult first.” He
was pleased to mention me by name, and acquainted the court, “That
Mr. _Whitefield_ had been travelling from common to common, making the
people cry, and then picking their pockets under pretence of collecting
money for the colony of _Georgia_, and knowing that _Gloucestershire_
was a populous county, he at last came there; that he had now several
curates, of which Mr. _Adams_ was one, who in his preaching had found
fault with the proceedings of the clergy, and had said, that if the
people went to hear them, they would be damned.” He added, that “there
had lately been such mobbing in _Staffordshire_, that a regiment
of soldiers was sent down to suppress them; insinuating, that the
Methodists were the authors; that we had now another cause of a like
nature depending in _Wiltshire_, and that we were not of that mild
pacific spirit, as we pretended to be.” This, and much more to the
same purpose, though foreign to the matter in hand, pleased many of the
auditors, who expressed their satisfaction, in hearing the Methodists
in general, and me in particular, thus lashed, by frequent laughing.
But our LORD not only kept me quite easy, but enabled me to rejoice
in being thus honoured for his great Name’s sake. To prove what the
defendants council had insinuated, they called up a young man, who was
a brother to one of the defendants, and one of the mob. He swore point
blank, “That Mr. _Adams_ said, if people went to church, they would
be damned, but if they would come to him, he would carry them to JESUS
CHRIST.” He swore also, “that the brook into which Mr. _A――――_ was
thrown, was no deeper than half up his legs.” He said first, that there
were but about ten of them that came to the house of Mr. _A――――_; and
then he swore, that there were about threescore. He said, there was
a bell, and that one of the defendants did ask Mr. _A――――_ to come
off the stairs, but that none of them went up to him: upon which Mr.
_A――――_ willingly obeyed, went with them briskly along the street,
and as he would have represented it, put himself into the skin-pit
and brook, and so came out again. He said also some other things; but
through the whole, his evidence appeared so flagrantly false, that one
of the council said, “It was enough to make his hair stand ♦on end.”
The judge himself wished, “That the man had so much religion as to fear
an oath.” So he went down in disgrace. Their second evidence was an
aged woman, mother of one of the defendants; she swore, “That her son
did go up stairs to Mr. _A――――_, and that Mr. _A――――_ tore her son’s
coat;” but she talked so fast, and her evidence was so palpably false,
that she was sent away in as much disgrace as the other. Their third
and last evidence, was father to one who was in the mob, tho’ not one
of the defendants. The chief he had to say was, “That when Mr. _A――――_
was coming from the brook, he met him and said, Brother, how do you do?
Upon which he answer’d, that he had received no damage, but had been
in the brook and came out again.” So that all their evidences, however
contrary one to another, yet corroborated ours, and proved the riot out
of their own mouths. The book was then given to a justice of the peace,
who had formerly taken up Mr. _C――――_ for preaching near _Stroud_,
and had lately given many signal proofs that he was no friend to the
Methodists. But he intending to speak only about their characters,
and the council and judge looking upon that as quite impertinent to
the matter in hand, he was not admitted as an evidence. Upon this, his
Lordship with great candor and impartiality summed up the evidence, and
told the jury, “That he thought they should bring all the defendants
in GUILTY; for our evidences had sufficiently proved the whole of the
information, and also, that the riot was premeditated.”――He said, “That,
in his opinion, the chief of the defendants evidence was incredible;
and, that supposing the Methodists were heterodox, (as perhaps they
might be) it belonged to the ecclesiastical government to call them to
an account; that they were subjects, and rioters were not to be their
reformers.” He also reminded them “of the dreadful consequences of
rioting at any time, much more at such a critical time as this; that
rioting was the forerunner of, and might end in rebellion; that it was
felony without benefit of clergy, to pull down a Meeting-house; and for
all as he knew, it was high treason to pull down even a bawdy-house.
――That this information also came from the _King’s-Bench_; that his
Majesty’s justices there, thought they had sufficient reason to grant
it; that the matters contained in it had been evidently proved before
them; and consequently they should bring in all the defendants guilty.”
Upon this the jury were desired to consider of their verdict, and
for a while there seemed to be some little demur among them. His
Lordship perceiving the cause of it, immediately informed them, “they
had nothing to do with the damages, (that was to be referred to the
_King’s-Bench_) they were only to consider, whether the defendants were
guilty or not.” Whereupon in a few minutes they gave a verdict for the
prosecutors, and brought in all the defendants _guilty_ of the whole
information lodged against them. I then retired to my lodgings, kneeled
down, and with my friends gave thanks to our all-conquering _Emmanuel_.
Afterwards I went to the inn, prayed and returned thanks with the
witnesses, exhorted them to behave with meekness and humility to
their adversaries; and after they had taken proper refreshment, I sent
them home rejoicing. In the evening I preached on these words of the
Psalmist, “By this I know that thou favourest me, since thou hast not
suffered mine enemy to triumph over me.” GOD was pleased to enlarge my
heart much. I was very happy with my friends afterwards, and the next
morning set out for _London_, where we had a blessed thanksgiving
season, and from whence I take the first opportunity of sending you
these particulars.

             I remain, Sir, your very affectionate friend,
                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Madam_,

SHALL I promise and not perform? GOD forbid! This comes in answer to
your commands, and to inform you, that through him who has the hearts
of all men in his hands, we came off more than conquerors, respecting
our _Gloucester_ trial. The rioters were brought in guilty, and I
suppose will have an execution issued out against them next Term. I
hear they are hugely alarmed; but they know not that we intend to let
them see what we could do, and then to forgive them. This troublesome
affair being now over, I must prepare for my intended voyage. They
tell me there is a ship going from _Portsmouth_. GOD willing, I
purpose to take my passage in it, and though calls come to me from
every quarter, yet I must; once more visit my dear family in _America_.
Some well-meaning people threaten me with I know not what, if I embark
at this time; but my absence hath been so long and unexpected, that
come what will, I am determined to prosecute my intended voyage; and
therefore whether we meet any more in the flesh, I trust we shall meet
in the world of spirits, where parting, weeping, and breaking of hearts
will no more disturb and try the affections of, dear Madam,

                     Yours in the dear _Emmanuel_,
                                                              _G. W._

                                           _Plymouth, June 26, 1744._

_My dear Friend_,

YOU see by this where I am. Doubtless you’ll wonder at the quick
transition from _Portsmouth_ to _Plymouth_. To the former I intended
going when I wrote last; but just before I took leave of the dear
tabernacle people, a message was sent to me, that the captain in which
I was to sail from thence, would not take me for fear of spoiling
his sailors. Some interpreted this as a call from providence not to
embark at this time; but I enjoined them silence ’till I had taken my
leave, and then, hearing of a mast-ship that was going under convoy
from _Plymouth_, I hastened thither, and have taken a passage in the
_Wilmington_, Capt. _Dalby_, bound to _Piscataway_, in _New-England_.
My first reception here was a little unpromising. A report being spread
that I was come, a great number of people assembled upon the _Hoe_,
(a large green for walks and diversions) and somebody brought out a
bear and a drum; but I did not come ’till the following evening, when,
under pretence of a hue-and-cry, several broke into the room where I
lodged at the inn, and disturbed me very much. I then betook myself to
private lodgings, and being gone to rest, after preaching to a large
congregation, and visiting the _French_ prisoners, the good woman of
the house came and told me, that a well-dressed gentleman desired to
speak with me. Imagining that it was some Nicodemite, I desired he
might be brought up. He came and sat down by my bedside, told me he
was a lieutenant of a man of war, congratulated me on the success of my
ministry, and expressed himself much concerned for being detained from
hearing me. He then asked me, if I knew him. I answered, no. He replied,
his name was _Cadogan_. I rejoined, that I had seen one Mr. _Cadogan_,
who was formerly an officer at _Georgia_, about a fortnight ago at
_Bristol_. Upon this, he immediately rose up, uttering the most abusive
language, calling me _dog_, _rogue_, _villain_, &c. and beat me most
unmercifully with his gold-headed cane. As you know I have not much
natural courage, guess how surprized I was; being apprehensive that
he intended to shoot or stab me, I underwent all the fears of a sudden
violent death. But, as it providentially happened, my hostess and her
daughter hearing me cry _murder_, rushed into the room and seized him
by the collar; however, he immediately disengaged himself from them,
and repeated his blows upon me. The cry of _murder_ was repeated also,
which putting him into some terror, he made towards the chamber-door,
from whence the good woman pushed him down stairs. About the bottom
of which, a second cry’d out, “Take courage, I am ready to help you;”
accordingly, whilst the other was escaping, he rushed up, and finding
one of the women coming down, took her by the heels and threw her
upon the stairs, by which her back was almost broken. By this time the
neighbourhood was alarmed. Unwilling to add to it, I desired the doors
might be shut, and so betook myself to rest, not without reflecting,
how indispensibly necessary it was for christians and christian
ministers to be always upon their guard, and with what great propriety
we are taught to pray in our excellent Litany, “from sudden,” that is,
“from violent and unprepared death, good LORD deliver us.” That this
may be our happy lot, is the hearty prayer of, dear Madam,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

SINCE my last, I have had some particular informations about the late
odd adventure. It seems, that four gentlemen came to the house of
one of my particular friends, kindly enquiring after me, and desired
to know where I lodged, that they might come and pay their respects.
He directed them. Soon afterwards I received a letter, informing me
that the writer was a nephew to Mr. _S――――_, an eminent attorney at
_New-York_; that he had the pleasure of supping with me at his uncle’s
house, and desired my company to sup with him and a few more friends at
a tavern. I sent him word, that it was not customary for me to sup out
at taverns, but should be glad of his company, out of respect to his
uncle, to eat a morsel with him at my lodgings. He came; we supped; and
I observed that he frequently looked around him, and seemed very absent;
but having no suspicion, I continued in conversation with him and my
other friends, ’till we parted. This, I now find, was to have been
the _assassin_; and being interrogated by his other companions on his
return to the tavern about what he had done, he answered, that being
used so civilly, he had not the heart to touch me. Upon which, as I am
informed, the person who assaulted me laid a wager of ten guineas that
he would do my business for me. Some say, that they took his sword from
him, which I suppose they did, for I only saw and felt the weight of
his cane. The next morning, I was to expound at a private house, and
then to set out for _Biddeford_. Some urged me to stay and prosecute;
but being better employed, I went on my intended journey, was greatly
blessed in preaching the everlasting gospel, and upon my return was
well paid for what I had suffered: curiosity having led perhaps two
thousand more than ordinary to see and hear a man, that had like to
have been murdered in his bed. Thus all things tend to the furtherance
of the gospel, and work together for good to those that love GOD.

              _Thus satan thwarts, and men object,_
              _And yet the thing they thwart, effect._

Leaving you to add an _Hallelujah_, I subscribe myself,

                           Ever, ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._

I Expected a line from you this morning; but I suppose you think we are
gone. This day came in a privateer, which saw the _Brest_ Squadron that
has pursued two of our men of war, the _Dreadnought_ and _Frederick_;
so that had we sailed, we should in all probability have been carried
into _France_. We are now to go under convoy of the grand fleet; many
letters from our friends at _Portsmouth_ inform us, that they are to
sail on _Sunday_; but the wind hath not been very favourable, so we may
yet stay some days longer. I never was so easy in this respect before.
In one or two things I find my will reluctant; but JESUS will bring all
things in subjection to him. I have been greatly refreshed this evening
in preaching his blood. The congregations grow visibly every day.
You will see the letter from _Kingsbridge_.――Last night many from the
_Dock_ came and guarded me home, being apprehensive there was a design
against me. Without my knowledge, they insulted a man who intended to
hurt me, for which I am sorry. We had a wonderful good time last night.
O help me to praise my Saviour! My health is better. I hope you got to
_London_ well. Whether we sail or not, expect to hear again from dear,
dear _J――――_,

                         Ever, ever yours, &c.

_My dear Friend_,

ACCEPT some few hasty lines from one, who, properly speaking, may at
present be stiled a prisoner at large. I am still here waiting for the
promised convoy, and as I humbly hope, really waiting for the convoy of
death to carry me to _Abraham_’s bosom. Could you think it? I have been
preaching a confirmation sermon. Do you ask me where? In a Quaker’s
field. As I saw thousands flocked to the church to have the Bishop’s
hands imposed upon them, I thought it not improper to let them have
a word of exhortation suitable to the occasion. I have also made an
elopement to _Kingsbridge_, where I preached to many thousands a few
days ago. It was really a most solemn occasion. A calling, inviting,
persuasive gift was vouchsafed me. The hearts of the auditory seemed
to be bowed as the heart of one man. Many tears were shed; but I was
obliged to ride off as soon as my discourse was ended, and to return
hither in the night. But blessed be God, our night was as it were
turned into day. I was accompanied by several old and new converts, and
we conversed in some degree, as became persons who ought to be employed
every hour and every moment in trimming their lamps to be ready for
the midnight cry, “Behold the bridegroom cometh!” As I am at present in
this unsettled state, continually engaged in preaching, and in talking
privately with many, very many awakened souls, you and my other friends
must be content with receiving short, but I hope truly loving letters,
from

                              Yours, &c.

MATTERS go on better and better here. I begin to think myself in
_London_. We have our regular morning meetings; and our LORD is pleased
to grace them with his presence. We are looking out for a place proper
for a society, and to expound in. People come daily to me, especially
from the _Dock_, under convictions. Some, I believe, have really closed
with CHRIST; and here are several aged persons perfectly made young
again. We are just now entered upon our singing hours.――The souls come
forward greatly in many respects, and friends are more and more hearty.
Fresh news from _Kingsbridge_ of souls being awakened; but I am kept
close prisoner on account of the convoy. Yesterday morning we were
called up at the _Dock_, very early, by a false alarm that our convoy
was come. Many poor souls much lamented it. We hastened hither, and I
expounded upon our LORD’s bidding his disciples to watch. This waiting
is much blessed to me. I am kept passive; notwithstanding, satan
attempts to disturb me, but JESUS refreshes me, and overcomes him. I
need not bid you to pray for me. Brother _C――――_ must come into these
parts soon.

                              Yours, &c.

OUR LORD has been giving us blessings in drops, but now he is sending
them in showers. This morning we have had a most precious meeting.
Perhaps more good hath been done by that one sermon, than by all I have
preached before. When GOD will work, who shall hinder? The wind is yet
against us. Our LORD detains me here for wise reasons. Some persons,
formerly prejudiced against me, have offered to give me a piece of
ground surrounded with walls, for a society room. I believe that one
will be built soon. Brother _C――――_ must stay in the _West_ some time.
The LORD JESUS blesses me with health, and a sweet preaching spirit. O
grace, grace! I will join with thee in praising it. Adieu, my friend,
I am yours, in the bonds of eternal love, whilst

_My dear, dear Friend_,

IT is past ten, or I would write you a long letter. Our convoy is come,
and perhaps we may sail to-morrow. It is delightful to be here. We come
from _Dock_ in the evenings, in great companies, singing and praising
GOD. Our parting there has been more awful than words can express. I
shall have sailed before you can answer this.

                                I.

                _Eternal JESUS, bless thy word,_
                _Be mindful of thy child;_
                _Behold thy servant; be thou, LORD,_
                _His helmet, sword, and shield._

                                II.

                _Close by thy side him ever keep;_
                _Still hold him in thy hand,_
                _Till he and all thy ransom’d sheep,_
                _Shall rest in their own land._

                                III.

                _The feast of jubilee._

If we never meet again in this suffering world, GOD grant that we may
ere long see each other in the heavenly paradise, where all tears shall
be wiped from our eyes, and death, sin, and sorrow we shall know no
more. Farewel.

                           Ever, ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Brother E――――_,

I Thank you for your last kind and loving letter, and as a token of
my unfeigned love to you, I send you these few lines by way of answer,
before I embark. Our convoy is now come, and in all probability we
shall sail this day or tomorrow. I need not stir up my dear brother,
and other dear souls with you, to pray for me and mine. I am quite easy
about trust, having put all things into the hands of the LORD JESUS,
upon whose shoulders the government of all is placed. He will, he does
order all things well: I bless him for it, and for what he has, and is
doing among the soldiers. I desire you all to bless him for what he is
doing in these parts; for preaching at the _Dock_ is now like preaching
at the _tabernacle_. It would delight your dear soul, my brother, to be
a spectator of the people’s seriousness. Last night we had a most awful
and solemn parting; many wept sorely. After sermon we walked pleasantly
over the fields, blessing and praising GOD. Our morning lectures
are very delightful. O the thousands that flock to the preaching of
Christ’s gospel! If brother _C――――_ is in _London_, pray salute him
in my name, and all the dear dear brethren and sisters, wishing you
all thousands and millions of blessings, and earnestly intreating
an interest in your prayers for me the chief of sinners. I subscribe
myself, my dear brother _E――――_,

       Yours most affectionately in the most adorable Redeemer,
                                                              _G. W._


_Postscript._ I must tell you one thing more. There is a ferry over to
_Plymouth_; and the ferrymen, which were like _Levi_ the publican at
the receipt of custom, are now so much my friends, that they will take
nothing of the multitude that come to hear me preach, saying, “GOD
forbid that we should sell the word of GOD.” O! the hearts of all men
are in the hand of the LORD!

                            _On board the Wilmington, Oct. 20, 1744._

_My dear Friend_,

YOU know in what a poor state of health I was, when I embarked. The
length, and seeming tediousness of the voyage, hath occasioned no small
addition to the violent pain in my side; however, blessed be GOD, in a
week or two after we sailed, we began to have a church in our ship. Two
serious _New-England_ friends finding how I was served at _Portsmouth_,
came from thence to _Plymouth_ in order to bear me company. We had
regular public prayer morning and evening, frequent communion, and days
of humiliation and fasting. Being time of war, and sailing out with
near 150 ships, we had several convoys. Their taking leave of each
other at their several appointed places, was striking: but ours was
ordered to convoy us all the way. We were soon, and have been often
alarmed. Once with the sight of a _Dutch_ fleet, whom we took for an
enemy; and again at the sight of Admiral _Balchen_, who rode by us
receiving the obeisance of the surrounding ships, as though he was Lord
of the whole ocean. It was full six weeks ere we reached the _Western_
Islands, off which it being calm weather, we continued floating for
some days; during which interval we were like to suffer much damage.
The wind having brisked up a little, and orders being given for tacking
about, one of the ships, I know not by what accident, having missed her
stays, in turning, came directly upon us; I happened at that time to
be singing a hymn upon deck with my little family, and thinking it best
to keep there to receive the shock, I had the opportunity of seeing
what passed. The ship struck her mainsail into our bowsprit, but our
ship being of a large, and theirs of a smaller size, our hull received
but little damage, whilst theirs received such a blow, that when
disentangled from us, they were immediately apprehensive of sinking. As
they again passed by us, when we expected another touch, their cries
and groans were awful. O how eagerly did they cry for some signal to be
given! It was done. A little after that, we came up with the convoy,
and our captain informed them of what had happened. The answer was,
“This is your praying, and be damned to ye.” With many expressions of
the like nature. This, I must own, shocked me more than the striking of
the ships. I called my friends together, and broke out into these words
in prayer: “GOD of the sea and GOD of the dry land! This is a night of
rebuke and blasphemy: shew thyself, O GOD, and take us under thy own
immediate protection; be thou our convoy, and make a difference between
those that fear thee and those that fear thee not!” The disabled ship
was taken into tow. Next morning they were saluted in like manner as
the night before, and orders were given us to follow our convoy into
_Fial_; but on a sudden a violent euroclydon arose, which not only
prevented our going into _Fial_, but battered and drove away our
convoy, so that we saw him no more all the voyage. For my own part, I
thought it no loss; we sailed very comfortably on, ’till we were again
alarmed with the sight of two ships, making up to us with all the sail
they could well croud, and which our captain took to be enemies. The
preparations for an engagement, to me, who you know am naturally a
coward, were formidable. Guns mounting, chains put about the masts,
every thing taken out of the great cabin, hammocks put about the sides
of the ship, and all, except myself, seemed ready for fire and smoke.
My wife, after having dressed herself to prepare for all events, set
about making cartridges, whilst the husband wanted to go into the holes
of the ship, hearing that was the chaplain’s usual place. I went, but
not liking my situation, and being desired by one of my _New-England_
friends to say something to animate the men, I crept up on deck, and
for the first time of my life beat up to arms by a warm exhortation.
The men seemed pleased, the apprehended enemy approached, but upon
nearer view we found them not only to be friends, but the two masts
ships that were going with us under the same convoy. This pleased us
all. The captain taking this opportunity to clean the cabin, said,
“After all, this is the best fighting:” with which you may be sure I
readily concurred, praying, and believing at the same time, that all
our various conflicts with spiritual enemies might, and would under
the conduct of the all-conquering captain of our salvation, at last
terminate in a thorough cleansing, and an eternal purification of the
defiled cabin of our hearts. Committing you to his almighty guidance
and protection, I subscribe myself,

                              Yours, &c.

_Dear Friend_,

DON’T judge me for not writing more frequent. It was impracticable. I
have been laid on a bed of sickness, and was, in the apprehension of
myself and others, at the very mouth of the heavenly harbour; but as
that more than once hath been the case, I am putting out to sea again.
O who would but follow the Redeemer blindfold? No convoy like him
who is the GOD of the sea and the GOD of the dry land. After eleven
weeks passage he hath brought us hither, but through my impatience
and imprudence I and my friends were like to suffer loss. A little
smack coming up to us just as we were near port, and being told that
she would be in several hours before the ship, I, with others in
complaisance to me, though persuaded to the contrary, ventured in her.
It soon grew dark, our pilots missed their inlet and we were tossed
about all night. My pain was great, having had for some time a nervous
cholic, and I was so hungry that I could have gnawed the very boards.
The fishermen had nothing but a few potatoes, of which I partook
most eagerly; but withal, thought my situation to be like the poor
disciples, who were rowing and toiling all night, when the wind was
contrary. About the fourth watch of the night, deliverance came; the
men discovered the proper inlet; but what passed before our arrival is
somewhat striking to me. One of my friends, on asking what news, was
answered, that the _New-England_ people were turned _new lights_; which
with us you know is a term for _heterodoxy_; but however, added the man,
not knowing that I was lying down at his elbow, they are all expecting
one Mr. _Whitefield_; and my sister, and a great company of her stamp,
were yesterday all praying for his safe arrival. This made me to take
courage. I continued undiscovered; and in a few hours in answer I trust
to _new light prayers_, we arrived safe at _York_, a few miles off
_Piscataway_, the place to which we were bound.――But you must excuse
enlarging; as I recover strength you shall hear again from

                              Yours, &c.

                                                _York, Nov. 6, 1744._

_Dear Sir_,

HOW thankful ought I to be to him, whose mercy endureth for ever! GOD
has commanded a physician (once a notorious deist, but through grace
converted at my last visit in _New-England_) to receive me here. Worthy
Colonel _P――――_, who lives at the very mouth of the harbour, on seeing
our ship, went with some other friends in his own boat to invite and
conduct me to his princely habitation. But GOD appointed otherwise. In
about half an hour after my arrival, I was put to bed, racked with a
nervous cholic, and convulsed from the waste down to my toes. A total
convulsion was immediately apprehended.

              _My wife and friends stood weeping by,_
              _In tears resolv’d to see me die._

Filled with divine consolation, I begged them not to be shocked. My
Saviour whispered that all was well, and therefore I desired them not
to be surprized if I should be totally convulsed, or be suffered in a
delirium to speak things that were wrong. Many, many of GOD’s dearest
children, through the infirmities which crazy constitutions more
especially are liable to, have been called to drink such a bitter cup
before me. But an all-compassionate Redeemer disappointed our fears,
and exceeded our strongest expectations. Apprehended convulsions were
kept off; and though I was so weak as not to be able to bear the sound
of a tread of the foot, or the voice of friends who came to see and
pray with me, yet my heart was kept in perfect peace. After undergoing,
for about four days, fomentations and exercises of different kinds,
by having my feet put into warm water, &c. nature was relieved, and
what I had taken four days before came away hardly discoloured. After
this, whilst carried about by my tender nurse and a servant, still
racked with pain, and like an helpless child, I could only say, “Look
and learn what a poor creature I am.” The scene affects me yet. May
it never be forgotten! I must retire, and leave enlarging to another
opportunity. In the mean while, assure yourself of my being, though
less than the least of all,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                           _Portsmouth, (New-England) Nov. 16, 1744._

_My dear Friend_,

AS I promised, I must employ a little of my new-gained strength in
writing to you. Soon after I began to recover, good old Mr. _M――――_
the minister of _York_, who feared the LORD greatly from his youth,
came to and accosted me thus: “Sir, you are first welcome to _America_;
secondly, to _New-England_; thirdly, to all the faithful ministers
in _New-England_; fourthly, to all the good people in _New-England_;
fifthly, to all the good people of _York_; and sixthly and lastly, to
me, dear Sir, less than the least of all.” He then urged me to give
them a sermon. Too forward to reingage in my old delightful work,
I complied, notwithstanding at the same time word had been sent to
_Boston_ that I was dying; upon which, my dear _Gaius_ and a beloved
physician came, either to take care of me, or attend my funeral; but
to their great surprize they found me in the pulpit. GOD was with me
but imprudently going over the ferry to _Portsmouth_, I caught cold,
immediately relapsed, and was taken, as every one thought, with death,
in my dear friend Mr. _Sherburne_’s house. My pains returned; but what
gave me most concern was, that notice had been given of my being to
preach the next evening. A great number of ministers and people flocked
to hear; three physicians attended me, and Colonel _Pepperel_ with many
others were so kind as to pay me a visit and sympathize with me. GOD
dealt so bountifully with me, that I was enabled to tell the Colonel in
particular, from heart-experience, that I felt a divine life distinct
from my animal life, which made me as it were to laugh at pain; this
made me determine to get up and preach, though the General and all had
left me, and the person appointed to lecture in my stead was just going
out of the house. My dear _York_ physician was then about to administer
a medicine. I on a sudden cried, “Doctor, my pains are suspended: by
the help of GOD I’ll go and preach, and then come home and die.” With
some difficulty I reached the pulpit. All looked quite surprized, as
though they saw one rose from the dead. Indeed, I was as pale as death,
and told them “they must look upon me as a dying man, that I came to
bear my dying testimony to the truths I had formerly preached amongst
them, and to the invisible realities of another world.” Nature (by my
continuing an hour in my discourse) was almost quite exhausted; but O
what life! what power spread all around! All seemed to be melted, and
were drowned in tears. The cry after me, when I left the pulpit, was
like the cry of sincere mourners when attending the funeral of a dear
departed friend. Upon my coming home, I was laid on a bed upon the
ground near the fire, and I heard them say, “He is gone;” but still,
you find by this I am alive, and if spared to be made instrumental
in making any poor dead soul alive to GOD, I shall rejoice that the
all-wise Redeemer has kept out of heaven a little longer,

                              Yours, &c.

                                             _Boston, Jan. 18, 1745._

_My dear Friend_,

BY this time I suppose you have heard, by your brother’s letter, how
good old Mr. _Moody_, in his honest way, said, I was welcome to all the
faithful ministers in _New-England_. But the good old man judged too
much by his own honest feelings. You see I am now at _Boston_, whither
I was brought from _Piscataway_ in a coach and four. The joy with which
I was received by the common people, cannot well be described; but
many of the ministers how shy?――And how different from what once they
were? When last in _Boston_, governor _Belcher_ was in the chair:
then, _reges ad exemplum, totus componitur orbis_, he honoured me
with great honour, and the clergy paid the nod, and obeyed. In many
I then perceived it was quite forced, and I think when at his table
I whispered to some and said, if ever I came again, many of those who
now seem extremely civil, will turn out my open and avowed enemies.
The event has proved, that in this respect I have been no false
prophet. You know where it is written, “There arose a king, who knew
not _Joseph_.” Freed therefore from their former restraint, many
have appeared in _puris naturalibus_. Some occasions of offence had
undoubtedly been given whilst I was here and preached up and down the
country.――Nothing however appeared but a pure, divine power working
upon, converting, and transforming people’s hearts, of all ranks,
without any extraordinary phænomena attending it. Good Mr. _T――――_
succeeded me; numbers succeeded him. Lecture upon lecture were set
up in various places; one minister called to another, to help drag
the gospel net; and by all the accounts that I can have from private
information, or good Mr. _Prince_’s weekly history, which I send you
with this, one would have imagined the millennium was coming indeed.
But you know, in this mixed state of things, wild-fire will necessarily
blend itself with the pure fire that comes from GOD’s altar. This the
enemy long waited for; at last it broke out and spread itself; and it
must be confessed, through the instrumentality of many good souls both
among clergy and laity, who for a while mistaking fancy for faith, and
imagination for revelation, were guilty of great imprudence. What these
were, I have not time now to particularize; I can only inform you, that
all is laid to me as being the _primum mobile_ though there was not
so much as the appearance of any thing of this nature when I left
_New-England_ last. But, maugre all, my poor labours are yet attended
with the usual blessings, and therefore I must entreat you as usual to
pray and give thanks in behalf of

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                                              _Boston, Feb. 6, 1745._

_My dear Friend_,

I Remember you once told me, that you heard one of the good old
_Puritans_, who went over to _New-England_, wrote back again, that
he went from _Old-England_ to avoid the Lord Bishops, and came to
_New-England_ to get under the Lord Brethren. Well is it at present
that they are the Lord Brethren; for finding some of their pastors
without cause shy of me, they have passed votes of invitation for me
to preach in the pulpits, and some time ago prevailed upon me, as they
heard I had done in _Scotland_, to set up a lecture at six o’clock in
the morning. Not expecting a very great auditory, I opened a lecture
in one of the smallest meetings, upon these words, “And they came early
in the morning to hear him;” but how was I disappointed? Such great
numbers flocked to hear, that I was obliged for the future to make use
of two of their very largest places of worship, where I believe seldom
less than two or three thousand attentive hearers hung as it were upon
me, to hear the word preached. I began with the first of _Genesis_,
and have now lectured in order, till I am almost come to the story of
_Abraham_ sending his servant to fetch a wife for his son _Isaac_. Many
I trust have been made willing to say, “I will go with the GOD-man,
even _Isaac_’s GOD.” It is impossible to describe the eagerness and
punctuality of these early visitants. To see so many hundreds of both
sexes neatly dressed, walking or riding so early along the streets to
get food for their souls, has feasted my own heart. The _Pharaohs_
who used to say, “Ye are idle, ye are idle,” now are struck dumb: for
lecture, and family prayer, and breakfast, are now over in many houses
before the sun is suffered to come into others windows; and it is now
become almost a common proverb, “That between _Tar-water_, and _early
rising_, the physicians will have no business.” One morning the croud
was so great, that I was obliged to go in at the window. The high
sheriff, who was once most forward in persecuting good Mr. _D――――t_,
being a little convinced under the word, accompanied me, and when he
put his head into the window after me, the people were ready to cry
out, “Is _Saul_ also among the prophets?” Hoping hereafter to send
you and other friends a further account of many such real instances
of all-conquering grace, I subscribe myself

AND how does my very dear brother _A――――_? I heard by some friend
lately that he was well.――I hope this will find him yet better, and
more and more happy in the ever-lovely, ever-loving JESUS.――I suppose
you have heard of his great goodness to me and mine.――We have been
carried through various trials; and can set up our _Ebenezer_, saying,
“Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.”――I cannot help thinking but that
the LORD JESUS is about to triumph gloriously.――He is pleased to bear
me as on eagles wings, and causes both sinners and saints to hear his
voice.――I am kept very happy, and see more and more of the mystery of
iniquity that lies in my heart. I rejoice in knowing that the blood of
JESUS will cleanse me from all.――I long to hear how it is with the dear
lambs in _Gloucestershire_.――I commit you and them to the care of the
compassionate bishop and shepherd of souls; and subscribe myself, my
dear man,

                      Yours most affectionately,

_Dear Madam_,

THIS leaves me just retired from my spiritual levee. Our good friend
Mr. _S――――_ tells me, while I am here he looks upon his house not as
his own, but mine. His parlour is large, and I sit there to receive
gospel visitants. Good Mr. _P――――_ told me some time ago, that I should
shortly be favoured with the company of a very pensive and uncommon
person; a man of good parts, ready wit, and lively imagination, and
who had made it his business, in order to furnish matter for preaching
over a bottle, to come and hear, and then carry away scraps of my
sermons, which it seems were to serve as texts or theses for his
tavern harangues. A few nights ago he came for this purpose to Doctor
_S――――_’s meeting; upon my coming in, he crouded after amongst the
people, and having got sufficient matter to work upon as he thought,
attempted to go out; but being pent in on every side, he found his
endeavours fruitless. Obliged thus to stay, and looking up to me,
waiting for some fresh matter for ridicule, GOD was pleased to prick
him to the heart. He came to Mr. _P――――_ full of horror, confessed
his crimes, and longed to ask my pardon, but was afraid to see me.
Mr. _P――――_ encouraged him to venture. This morning hearing somebody
knock at the parlour door, I arose, and upon opening the door, by the
paleness, pensiveness, and horror of his countenance, guessed I had
met with the person of whom Mr. _P――――_ had apprized me. Immediately
he cried with a low but plaintive voice, “Sir, can you forgive me?” I
smiled and said, “Yes, Sir, very readily.” Indeed, replied he, Sir, you
cannot when I tell you all, I then asked him to sit down; and judging
that he had sufficiently felt the lashes of the law, I preached to
him the gospel. That it may be the power of GOD through faith unto his
eternal salvation, you will join in praying, dear madam, with

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DLXVII.


                            _To Mrs. ――――._

                                             _Boston, Feb. 19, 1745._

_My dear Friend_,

_TEMPORA mutantur_; a confederacy, a confederacy! The clergy, amongst
whom are a few mistaken, misinformed good old men, are publishing
halfpenny testimonials against me. Even the president, professors, and
tutors of _Hertford_ college, where I was, as you know, some few years
ago received with so much uncommon respect, have joined the confederacy.
Good Mr. _C――――_, that venerable, truly primitive, good old Puritan,
as I am informed, had many of these testimonials brought him, in order
to judge of their importance. He took them, weighed them in his hands
and having read them before, returned them immediately, saying, “They
did not weigh much.” However, I thank GOD, “out of the eater hath come
forth meat.” They have done me real service. Some unguarded expressions,
in the heat of less experienced youth, I certainly did drop. I was much
too precipitate in hearkening to, and publishing private informations,
and thereby _Peter_-like cut too many ears off: but this is my comfort,
when we mean well, though no thanks to our own too forward though
well-meant zeal, JESUS, that almighty, all-compassionate physician,
will heal and restore the ears again. Some good friends on my side
the question are publishing testimonials in my favour. Thus you see
what a militant state we are in at present. _Laudatur ab eis, culpatur
ab illis._ Amidst all, the word runs and is glorified, and many are
so enraged at the treatment I meet with, that they came to me lately,
assuring me, that if I’ll consent, they will erect in a few weeks
time, the outside of the largest place of worship that was ever seen
in _America_; but you know ceiled houses were never my aim. I therefore
thanked them for, but at the same time begged leave to refuse the
accepting of their kind offer. How or when the present storm will
subside, for subside I am persuaded it will, is as yet uncertain. I
can only, at present, earnestly beg the continuance of your prayers,
that whilst tossing in this floating ark I may be purged of some of
my corruptions, and be kept in good temper towards those who I believe
really think they do GOD’s service in opposing, dear Madam,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear, dear J._

THIS comes by Captain _Darling_. I hear from _Boston_, a bookseller has
got the books you sent over. I have sent a letter to Doctor _C――――_,
with my answer to _Harvard_ college, which I would have you print, with
their testimony, (which is an original:) and my answer to the second
part of the observation and remarks upon the charge of the Bishop of
_L――――_. May JESUS give them his blessing. I would have them printed
so as to be sold cheap: you may collect or print them severally as you
will. I cannot yet get time to prepare my sermons, or the other part
of my life, for the press. I am writing another _New-England_ journal,
which I will send when I leave it; when that will be, I know not. I
expect Mr. _Habersham_ every hour. _W―――― N――――_ and _J――――_ are got
safe to _Charles-Town_. I heard from friends there last week. _America_,
I am afraid, begins to be too dear to me. The LORD smiles upon me and
mine, and makes us very happy in himself, and happy in one another.
Here is a very large field of action. A very fine and effectual door
is opened; my bodily strength is recovered, and my soul more than ever
in love with a crucified JESUS. I could write more to you and other
dear friends, but if I do, I shall neglect things of a more public and
immediate concern; neither can my dear wife write, because she is fully
employed in copying my letters. However, we do not forget our dear
_London_ and _English_ friends. We pray for them often, and sometimes
cannot help wishing some more may come over into this delightful
wilderness; it is a fruitful field. JESUS waters it with his blessings.
We expect sister _W――――_. Here are wars and rumours of wars, on this,
as well as your side of the water. But JESUS’s disciples may be at
peace. O that this may find thy dear heart quite swallowed up in his
amazing love! Be pleased to remember us most tenderly to _all_, and
lose no opportunity of sending a line in any _American_ ships. So, my
very dear dear man, I rest

          Thy very affectionate happy friend, and servant in
                             JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Brother C――――_,

IT gives me some concern, that I cannot send thee a long letter, but
at present I have so many things of importance before me, which must be
immediately dispatched, that I desire others to excuse me too. I do not
forget any of you as I know of, and, GOD willing, shall redeem every
opportunity of sending to _England_. Our Saviour wonderfully smiles
on us here; several years work I think lies before me. The LORD helps
me to preach with the demonstration of the spirit and with power,
my strength is daily renewed, and my wife and I go on like two happy
pilgrims, leaning upon our beloved. O help us to adore and praise free
grace. We salute all the conference and trustees, and every particular
choir, and the societies in every place, “Grace, mercy and peace be
multiplied upon them, from GOD our father, and from the LORD JESUS
CHRIST.” To his tender mercy do I commit thee and them, and am, my very
dear _C――――_,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

I Wrote to you last week, and have sent you by Capt. _Darling_ two
letters, and a box. This comes by a young gentleman that expects to
return to _South-Carolina_ by _August_ next. By him I send you one of
each sort of the pamphlets that I have published here. I would have
them sent to _Scotland_ as soon as may be. My wife has sent you a few
lines in one of my letters. We are more than happy! O grace! grace!――I
trust it is so with you. _America_ is pleasanter and pleasanter every
day. I expect Mr. _Habersham_ hourly. The door for preaching opens
wider and wider. O my dear friend, I could tell thee what would rejoice
thy heart, wast thou here. But I have little time to write. I am now
going to prepare my sermons for the press: And am also writing another
journal. You shall have them the first opportunity. Our tender love
awaits all dear friends. As often as possible, you and others shall
hear from, my dear friend, &c.

_My very dear, dear Brother H――――_,

HOW do you find your heart these trying, sifting, purging times? I hope
you are enabled to joy in GOD, and are made more than conqueror through
his love. It has given me some concern that I could not write to you
oftner: but JESUS knows my heart has been with you; and I have not
failed to pray for the preservation of the tossed ark. ♦_Antinomianism_,
I find, begins to shew its head and stalk abroad: may the glorious
Redeemer cause it to hide its head again, and prevent his children’s
spirits being imbittered against each other. I am glad to hear the
_Welsh_ brethren continue steady: and that amongst our _English_
friends, _Antinomianism_ seems only to be speculative; this is a great
evil, but not so great as when it affects the practice, and leads the
people of GOD unwarily into licentiousness. The late outward troubles,
I hope will do good, and put a stop to the many disputes and various
sects which, like so many hydra’s, always spring up when the LORD
suffers false principles to abound. I expect to hear that JESUS has
made thee immoveable like a wall of brass, held as a lion, but meek
as a lamb. Blessed be his name, he continues to be very kind to us: we
have been six months in these parts, and are now going northwards for
the summer season. The Orphan-house is in a promising way. My temporal
affairs begin to be settled; and I am blessed substantially to many
souls. JESUS, I trust, has given me a more gospel-heart; and causes
many of my professed most imbittered enemies to be at peace with me. I
know you will help me to praise him, and beg him to continue to stand
by a poor unworthy creature, who simply desires to spend and be spent
for the good of precious and immortal souls. You’ll remember me to your
dear wife, and all our _Welsh_ brethren, in the most endearing manner:
we frequently talk of, and pray for them; and don’t despair of seeing
them once more in the flesh. My dear wife loves them exceedingly, and
warms her heart often by reflecting on past times. Wishing that grace,
mercy, and peace may be multiplied upon you all, I subscribe myself, my
very dear brother,

                      Ever, ever thine in JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Madam_,

YOU will be surprized to hear that a messenger of the prince of peace,
especially such a weak creature as I am, should beat up to arms. No
doubt you have judged me, as well you may; but providence seemed to
force me to it. You have now heard of the _Cape-Breton_ expedition,
which was carried on and finished with the greatest secrecy and
expedition here, before it could be scarcely known to you at home.
Worthy Colonel _P――――_ was fixed upon to command. The day before he
accepted of the commission, he purposed to dine with me to ask my
advice. I told him, “that I hoped if he did undertake it, he would
beg of the LORD GOD of armies to give him a single eye; that the means
proposed to take _Louisburgh_, in the eye of human reason, were no
more adequate to the end, than the sounding of rams horns to blow down
_Jericho_; that the eyes of all would be upon him; and if he should
not succeed in the intended enterprize, the widows and orphans of the
slain soldiers would be like lions robbed of their whelps; but if it
pleased GOD to give him success, envy would not suffer him to take
the glory, and therefore he should take great care that his views were
disinterested, and then I doubted not, if providence really called him,
he would find his strength proportioned to the day, and would return
more than conqueror.” He thanked me, and his Lady having given her free
consent, he commenced general. The sound now was to arms! to arms! new
recruits were eagerly sought after, and my worthy friend Mr. _S――――_
was appointed one of the commissaries. Being at his house, he told me
one evening that he was preparing the flag, and that I must give him
a motto, and that the people must know it too. I absolutely refused,
urging that it would be acting out of character; he replied, that the
expedition, he believed, was of GOD, and that if I did not encourage
it, many of the serious people would not inlist. I still refused; he
desired me to consider, and sleep upon it, and to give him my answer
in the morning. I retired, I prayed, I slept; and upon his renewing
his request in the morning, I told him, that since he was so urgent,
and as I did not know but divine providence might intend to give us
_Louisburgh_, therefore he might take this motto. _Nil desperandum
Christo duce._ Upon this, great numbers inlisted, and before their
embarkation, their officers desired me to give them a sermon: I
preached from these words: “As many as were distressed, as many as
were discontented, as many as were in debt, came to _David_, and he
became a captain over them.” Officers, soldiers, and others attended.
I spiritualized the subject, and told them how distressed sinners came
to JESUS CHRIST the Son of _David_; and in my application exhorted the
soldiers to behave like the soldiers of _David_, and the officers to
act like _David_’s worthies; then, I made no manner of doubt, but we
should receive good news from _Cape-Breton_. After this, I preached
to the general himself, who asked me if I would not be one of his
chaplains: I told him, “I should think it an honour, but believed,
as I generally preached three times a day in various places to large
congregations I could do my King, my country, and my GOD, more service,
by stirring up the people to pray, and thereby strengthen his and his
soldiers hands.” Through divine grace, I was enabled to persist in this
practice for some weeks; but at last news arrived that the case was
desperate. Letter upon letter came from one officer and another to
those who planned this expedition, and did not know the strength of the
fortress. I smiled, and told my friends, that I believed now we should
have _Louisburgh_;――that all having confessed their helplessness, GOD
would now reveal his arm, and make our extremity his opportunity. I was
not disappointed of my hope; for one day having taken a weeping leave
of dear _Boston_, and being about to preach a few miles out of the
town, news was brought that _Louisburgh_ was taken. Numbers flocked
with great joy from all quarters, and I immediately preached to them
a thanksgiving sermon from these words: “By this I know that thou
favourest me, since thou hast not permitted mine enemies to triumph
over me.” Here ends, dear Madam, my beating to arms. It is left to you,
to judge as you please of, dear Madam,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._


_Postscript._ I forgot to tell you, to the honour of worthy Madam
_P――――_, that during the time of the expedition, at her desire, I
preached in the General’s house, and took the liberty before sermon,
to ask her, how she came to give up the General? She answered, “That it
was GOD who enabled her to do it for his glory, and her country’s good,
and that now the General was gone, she had the pleasing reflection,
that thro’ divine mercy, home had never been made so disagreeable to
him by her conduct, as to make him wish to be gone.”

_Honoured Mother_,

WHETHER your affections are abated to me or not, (which one would
imagine by your not writing in two years) yet duty, love, and gratitude
oblige me to write to her, to whom, under GOD, I owe my being brought
into the world. I am glad to find by a letter from Mr. _Syms_, dated
last _March_, that you was well, at least I hoped so, because I heard
nothing to the contrary. May the Father of mercies, and GOD of all
consolation, grant that your latter end may greatly increase! Whether
you ever see me or not any more, you need not be anxious concerning
me.――That GOD whom I serve in the gospel of his dear Son, is exceeding
good and gracious to me and mine. We have all things pertaining to life
and godliness. Many offers are daily made me; but as yet the LORD JESUS
keeps me from catching at the golden bait. Favour is given to me in
the sight of the rich and great, and the door for my usefulness opens
wider and wider. I love to range in the _American_ woods, and sometimes
think I shall never return to _England_ any more. I was never better
in health, take all together. My dear wife would send you a few lines,
but she is weak by reason of a miscarriage about four days ago. I send
you most dutiful respects for her, and praying the LORD of all Lords
continually to lift up the light of his blessed countenance upon your
dear soul, I subscribe myself, honoured mother,

                Your most dutiful, though unworthy son,
                                                              _G. W._

_Rev. and dear Sir_,

I Took the freedom some months ago to send you a letter, wherein was
inclosed a letter for Professor _Frank_, both which I hope came safe to
hand, and were accepted in love. Since that, I have been travelling and
ranging the woods, in the service of the best of Masters, who makes his
work more pleasant to me every day. I trust that the time for favouring
this and the neighbouring southern provinces is come. Every where
almost, the door is opened for preaching; great numbers flock to hear;
and the power of an ascended Saviour attends the word. It is surprizing,
how the LORD causes prejudices to subside, and makes my formerly most
bitter enemies to be at peace with me. O Rev. Sir, help me to praise
him, whose mercy endureth for ever! I doubt not but he has been
wonderfully good to you, and supports you under a feeble tottering
tabernacle. The prayers of me and mine are always for you, because we
honour and love you in our common head, the blessed JESUS. Be pleased,
when you write, to present my most dutiful and affectionate respects
to the Professor, and Mr. _Ulspurgher_. I have had some sweet times
with several of the _Lutheran_ ministers at _Philadelphia_. I love them
dearly. Mr. _Drisezler_ does bravely at _Frederica_. Mr. _Boltzius_ and
his collegue I hear are well. By and by, I trust, _Georgia_ will lift
up its drooping head.――All is well at the Orphan-house. I am, Rev. and
very dear Sir,

      Your most affectionate, though unworthy younger brother and
                          servant in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear, dear Brother_,

I Just now received a wished-for packet from _England_, in which are
two or three letters from you. My dear fellow pilgrim will exceedingly
rejoice at the receipt of them. She is gone forward with a _Boston_
young lady towards _Georgia_.――I hear they traverse the woods bravely.
――I wrote to you very lately.――I can only send you a few loving lines
now.――I am just setting out.――Lately I have been in seven counties in
_Maryland_, and preached with abundant success.――Our LORD gives me
health, and his work (O free grace!) prospers in my unworthy hands. I
shall consider of the calls sent me to return to my native country.――My
tender love to all.――I am, my very dear man,

_My very dear Brother_,

JUST now I have received your kind letter with some others, but have
not time to read them all, being just setting out from this place.
I shall consider of your _loud call_, and pray our LORD to direct
me.――Poor _English_ friends! May JESUS heal their divisions! Courage,
my dear brother――Land is in sight――Ere long we shall sail into the
haven of eternal rest.――The harvest is great here. I have lately been
in seven counties in _Maryland_, and preached to great congregations of
people with great power.――I have now a journey of seven hundred miles
before me.――My tender love to all. GOD willing, you shall hear again
shortly from,

                  Ever yours in our triumphant JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

                          _Hanover county, (Virginia) Nov. 16, 1746._

_My very dear Brother_,

ABOUT a week ago I had the pleasure of receiving a long letter from
you, which I immediately answered at _Anapolis_.――That you wrote to my
dear wife is gone to her, and I suppose will rejoice her exceedingly.
――She is well, and enjoys much of GOD.――I was glad to find that the
_Tabernacle_ was given up to your care.――Whether its breaches are yet
repaired, or whether it be entirely fallen down, I know not.――I suppose
when I come to _England_, I shall have all to begin again.――It is the
LORD, let him do what seemeth him good.――The account of dear brother
_H――――_’s trial affected me much. I rejoice that he comes bright out
of the furnace of affliction. I salute him and all my dear friends most
tenderly.――Sometimes affection works strong, and I almost determine
to come over.――But the cloud does not seem to move that way as yet.
――However, my eyes are to the LORD.――Whenever his providence points out
the way, the language of my heart is, “Lo I come.”――I wrote to brother
_H―――― J――――_ and _A――――_ lately, and since have received their kind
letters.――I have lately been in seven counties in _Maryland_, and ere
long think to preach in as many in this province.――There is a sweet
stirring among the dry bones.――I have a thousand tender things to say,
but time will not permit.――Well, my dear dear man, heaven is at hand;
――there we shall have talk enough.――O let us take as many souls with
us to that blessed place as we can.――Blessed be GOD, my soul springs
with fresh desires to hunt after poor straying sheep, which JESUS has
purchased with his dear heart’s blood.――O that I may begin now to do
something for him, who hath done and suffered so much for me! But I can
no more.――I am lost, I am quite overcome when I think of this.――LORD,
I believe and worship!――Pray remember me to _all_ most tenderly.
――Remember me before the LORD as the _chief of sinners_, but, my very
dear brother,

                           Ever, ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DLXXVIII.


                       _To a friend in London._

                                           _Bethesda, Dec. 24, 1746._

_My dear Brother_,

I Thank you heartily for your very kind letter, which I now snatch a
few moments to answer. The account you gave of things, made me mourn
that they were in so bad a situation, and at the same time I could
not help rejoicing they were no worse: You and all that attended on
my preaching, and had opportunities to converse with me privately,
cannot be ignorant how many hints I gave of what has happened. It might
have been foreseen and spoken of without a spirit of prophecy, and
consequently did not so much surprise me when I found it came to pass;
but I trust the storm is now blown over, and that the little flock will
enjoy a sweet calm. O that your eyes may be looking towards and waiting
on the blessed JESUS: from him alone can come your salvation, he will
be better to you than a thousand _Whitefields_.――I am afraid you are
too desirous of having me with you; and indeed I long to see you and
my other dear christian friends, but _America_ seems to be my scene
of action for some time. The harvest is great in many places, and the
labourers are very few. I am resolved in the strength of JESUS to range
more and more; hunting for souls is a delightful work, and I am ashamed
that I do no more. O my dear man, pray for me; indeed I do for you and
yours.――I am glad the LORD has appeared for you; he never fails those
that put their trust in him; only remember, “In the world, and yet not
_of_ it,” is the real christian’s motto.――That JESUS may continually
lift up the light of his blessed countenance upon you, give you and
yours all peace and joy in believing, is the earnest prayer of, my dear
man,

      Your very affectionate friend, and servant for JESUS sake,
                                                              _G. W._


_P. S._ My tender tender love to all enquiring friends; my dear
yoke-fellow joins heartily: we are happy in JESUS, and happy in one
another.




                            LETTER DLXXIX.


                                           _Bethesda, Dec. 24, 1746._

_My dear Brother_,

I Must not let your kind letter which I received a few days ago lie
long unanswered. And now what shall I say? why that I would have you
comfort yourself with this promise, “That all things shall work (nay
_do_ work) for good to those that love GOD.”――Blessed be GOD for that
little, that great word ALL.――Could we always act faith upon that,
nothing could move us.――It is this promise that makes me now to
rejoice in the midst of all the tribulations that has befallen my dear
_Tabernacle_ friends.――For ere long you shall sing,

                _――――――――O happy Rod!_
                _That brought us nearer to our GOD!_

Courage, therefore, my brother, courage.――The LORD will yet uphold you
with his right hand.――Only live near to JESUS, and let the language of
your heart be, “LORD, _let me know myself and thee!_” All trials are
sent for these two ends, that we may be better acquainted with the dear
LORD JESUS, and with our own wicked hearts.――That you may increase in
this knowledge more and more, is the earnest prayer of

           Your affectionate friend, and servant in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._


_P. S._ My dear wife joins in sending hearty salutations to all.――I
must refer you to other letters for news.




                             LETTER DLXXX.

                                           _Bethesda, Dec. 29, 1746._

_My very dear Brother A――――_,

SINCE I wrote to you from _Maryland_, I have received two or three kind
letters from you, in which I have had a particular account how affairs
stand in _England_.――I bless GOD for the gracious assistance he has
been pleased to afford you, and pray for a continuance and increase
of it to your dear soul ever more and more――O my very dear brother, it
is no small favour to be kept steady and humbly bold for the glorious
_Emmanuel_ in a cloudy dark day.――This honour the LORD JESUS has
conferred on you――May his past goodness strengthen your faith, and
encourage you to trust in him amidst all future trials!――I say future
trials――for we must never expect an entire cessation of arms, till we
bow down our heads and give up the ghost――Our trials will be changed
in order to discover to us the remainder of corruption in the heart;
but they will not, they must not be entirely removed――The captain
or our salvation was made perfect through sufferings, and so must
we――Be strong therefore, my brother, in the grace which is in CHRIST
JESUS――Endure afflictions――make full proof of thy ministry――Truth is
great, and will prevail――Fail not writing――Other letters will acquaint
you with particulars about me.――Continue in prayer, and it may be,
sooner than your expectations, you may see

      Your very unworthy, but affectionate brother and servant in
                             JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._


_P. S._ My dear yoke-fellow joins in sending most cordial salutations
to you, yours, and all that love the precious CHRIST.


                                       _Charles-Town, Jan. 21, 1747._

Since I wrote the above I have had some sweet seasons at _Bethesda_: I
intend staying here some days, and will redeem what time I can to write
to friends――May grace, mercy and peace be multiplied upon them all:
Amen and Amen.――My dear wife and family are well――GOD willing, we move
northward in the beginning of _March_.




                            LETTER DLXXXI.


                         _To Mr. H―――― J――――._

                                       _Charles-Town, Jan. 23, 1747._

_My very dear Brother_,

I Owe you much love, and though I have written to you more than once,
yet I look upon myself as indebted to you still.――I therefore now sit
down to answer the kind letter which you sent my dear yokefellow.――She
is now at _Georgia_, and having not as yet seen it, she cannot answer
it herself.――Blessed be GOD she is well, and prospers both in soul and
body――We talk of you often, and hope yet to live and have our hearts
warmed with our _English_ and _Welch_ friends ere we go hence, and are
no more seen. At present the cloud seems to hang over the _American_
parts.――The LORD JESUS is pleased to give me great access to multitudes
of souls, and I hope has withal given me as strong an inclination as
ever, to go out and preach to them the unsearchable riches of his dying
love. I lately came from _Bethesda_, and found my family well, happy
in JESUS, and happy in one another.――Our LORD bowed the heavens several
times and came down among us, in the power of his eternal Spirit.――In
the beginning of _March_, I purpose, GOD willing, to set out for the
northward again, and shall not lose any opportunity of writing, that
offers in my way. I am sorry to hear the leaven of _Antinomianism_ is
not yet purged out, and that animosities are not yet ceased.――I can say
nothing at this distance, but pray that the GOD of peace and love may
direct and rule all my dear friends hearts. You will remember me to all
in the most tender manner.――Indeed I omit no opportunity of sending.――I
pray for you all continually, and begging a continued interest in all
your prayers, I subscribe myself, my very dear brother,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

                  _To a generous Benefactor unknown._

                                     _Charles-Town, March, 15, 1747._

WHOEVER you are that delight to imitate the divine beneficence in doing
good to your fellow-creatures when they know not of it, I think it my
duty, in behalf of the poor orphans committed to my care, to send you
a letter of thanks for your kind, generous and opportune benefaction.
――That GOD who has opened your heart to give so bountifully, will
as bountifully reward you.――I trust you have contributed towards the
promoting an institution, which has, and I believe will redound much
to the Redeemer’s glory.――Blessed be GOD, I hope I can say, that
_Bethesda_ was never in better order than it is now, in all probability
taking root downwards, and bearing fruit upwards.――Since my arrival
there this winter, I have opened a _Latin_ school, and have several
children of promising abilities that have begun to learn.――One little
orphan, who this time twelvemonth could not read his letters, has made
a considerable proficiency in his _Accidence_.――The blessed spirit has
been striving with several of the children’s infant hearts, and I hope
ere long to see some ministers sent forth from that despised place
called _Georgia_. It is true, the constitution of that colony is very
bad, and it is impossible for the inhabitants to subsist themselves
without the use of slaves. But GOD has put it into the hearts of my
_South-Carolina_ friends, to contribute liberally towards purchasing
a plantation and slaves in this province; which I purpose to devote to
the support of _Bethesda_.――Blessed be GOD, the purchase is made.――I
last week bought, at a very cheap rate, a plantation of six hundred and
forty acres of excellent land, with a good house, barn, and out-houses,
and sixty acres of ground ready cleared, fenced and fit for rice,
corn, and every thing that will be necessary for provisions. One negroe
has been given me.――Some more I purpose to purchase this week.――An
overseer is put upon the plantation, and I trust a sufficient quantity
of provision will be raised this year.――The family at _Bethesda_
consists of twenty-six.――When my arrears are discharged; I purpose to
increase the number.――I hope that time will soon come; and that he who
has begun, will go on to stir up the friends of _Zion_ to help me, not
only to discharge the arrears, but also to bring the plantation lately
purchased to such perfection, that if I should die shortly, _Bethesda_
may yet be provided for.――As you have been such a benefactor, I thought
proper to give you this particular account, that you may see it is not
given in vain.――I could enlarge, but have only room to subscribe myself,
generous friend,

                      Your most obliged servant,
                                                              _G. W._

                             _To Mrs. B._

                  _Bohemia, (Maryland) Sunday night, April 26, 1747._

_Very dear Mrs. B._

IF you will promise not to be sorry, that you set out so soon, I will
inform you, that through the singular goodness of a loving Redeemer,
we reached _Bohemia_ last night, after a pleasant journey of about
five weeks from _Charles-Town_. To-day, I trust we have enjoyed some
taste of that love, which I pray the LORD of all Lords to shed abroad
abundantly in your dear heart by the Holy Ghost. You are entered upon
a scene that will call for more than ordinary assistance. JESUS, who
himself was once in a wilderness, knows how to succour, support and
comfort you. “Out of the eater he can bring forth meat; Out of the
strong he can and will bring forth sweetness.” My poor prayers do
and will follow you. I trust you will return loaded with experience;
and however your journey may turn out in respect to your body, I am
persuaded it will be for the benefit of your soul. To tell you how
bountifully the glorious _Emmanuel_ hath dealt with us, would fill a
volume. He hath indeed done wonders for us,――some of which I hope to
relate to you, when I see you face to face. After two days abode here,
I purpose, GOD willing, to take a three weeks circuit in hunting after
_Maryland_ sinners. In _Virginia_, for the present, the door is shut;
but I believe it will be open in the fall to more advantage. I have
no thoughts of visiting it this spring. The cloud moves another way.
However, night and day I shall remember you in your little hut, praying
that you may meet with agreeable company to join in saying, “LORD JESUS,
all my springs are in thee.” that you may be continually enabled to
believe on him, and find him to be a well of water springing up to life
eternal, is the hearty prayer of, very dear Mrs. _B――――_,

       Your very affectionate, sympathizing friend, and willing
                       servant for JESUS’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DLXXXIV.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. F――――._

                                           _Bohemia, April 28, 1747._

_Rev. and very dear Brother_,

WITH this, I send you a packet from your brother, whom I left well
and happy at _Bethesda_ about six weeks ago. As I came along I saw
Mr. _Davis_. He is licensed, as are the four houses in _Virginia_; but
there is a proclamation issued out against all itinerants. Nothing can
be done to the purpose, but all will be in the utmost confusion, unless
some proper person is always resident among the awakened souls. Pray
acquaint your brethren of this. How do you all? Has JESUS warmed your
hearts this last cold Winter, and kept you from spiritual frost? He
has been very gracious to us southward; and as we came along, “the
wilderness seemed to blossom like a rose.” About five weeks ago, we
left _Charles-Town_, and reached _Bohemia_ last _Saturday_ evening.
We came from _Hanover_ county to this place in five days. I am now
dispatching my private affairs, and after about three weeks itinerant
preaching in these parts, I purpose, GOD willing, to go towards
_Philadelphia_. You will remember me in a particular manner to the
young students.――They have a continual share in my poor prayers; and
the continuance of theirs and yours is earnestly desired by, my very
dear Sir,

                 Yours most affectionately in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DLXXXV.


                  _To the Honourable F. W――――, Esq._

                                  _New-Town, (Maryland) May 6, 1747._

_Honoured Sir_,

A Few days past I had the pleasure of yours, dated _November_ 28th.
I embrace this first opportunity of returning you my hearty thanks
for the unmerited kindness and affection expressed therein. May the
Redeemer give me an humble heart, and grant that all favours conferred
upon me by instruments, may lead me nearer to him, the source and
fountain of all! But what shall I say to dear _New-England_’s sorrowful
circumstances? It pities me to hear that she is still lying in the
dust. However, this has generally been the case: trying and distressing
times have generally followed awakening and converting times. May JESUS
second them with another alarm of his holy spirit, and then all will
be well. Glad would I be to come and offer myself once more to do
_New-England_ service; but I am afraid that many ministers and the
heads of the people would not bear it. However, was this my only reason,
it would soon be answered.――But here are thousands in these Southern
parts (as you have observed, honoured Sir), that scarce ever heard
of redeeming grace and love. Is it not my duty as an itinerant, since
other places have had their calls and awakening seasons, to go where
the gospel has not been named? Those who think I want to make a party,
or to disturb churches, do not know me. I am willing to hunt in the
woods after sinners; and, according to the present temper of my mind,
could be content that the name of _George Whitefield_ should die, if
thereby the name of my dear Redeemer could be exalted. Indeed I am
amazed that he employs me at all. But what shall we say? He hateth
putting away, therefore I am not consumed. Grace, sovereign free grace!
shall be all my song. Last Winter’s mercies have renewed my obligations
to extol free grace. I could enlarge, but several things forbid. In
heaven, dear Sir, we shall have no interruptions. That you may be
supported through all the fatigues of your journey thither, and with
all your dear family, at length arrive at the land of eternal rest, is
the earnest prayer of, honoured Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._


_Postscript._ Fearing I shall not have an opportunity of seeing you,
before you embark for _England_, it being uncertain whether your honour
will be at _Philadelphia_ upon my coming there, I think it my duty,
honoured Sir, in this way to wish you, your honoured Lady and little
Miss, an extraordinary good voyage. May the GOD of the seas as well
as the GOD of the dry land, be your convoy and pilot! May you and all
who sail with you, be preserved from the hand of the enemy, and kept
in perpetual peace and safety! As GOD shall enable me, my poor prayers
shall follow you. They are your due, honoured Sir. The _Pensylvanians_
I am sure will soon regret the loss of you, and all the friends of
liberty and loyalty must be constrained to wish you well. O that the
great Governor of the universe may so bless you with his holy spirit,
that you may bring forth much fruit in old age! O that you may hear
the great Judge of quick and dead salute you at the last day, with a
“Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy
of thy LORD!” This, honoured Sir, is the native language of my heart.
As I trust you think me sincere, be pleased to accept it, as the best
acknowledgment I can make you and your beloved consort, for all the
kindnesses you have been pleased to heap on, honoured Sir,

              Your Honour’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DLXXXVI.


                           _To Mrs. P――――._

                                  _New-Town, (Maryland) May 6, 1747._

_Dear Mrs. P――――_,

I Must refrain no longer from returning you thanks for two or three
kind letters with which you have favoured me. They seemed to speak
the language of a heart concerned for _Zion_’s glory. Well! Blessed
are they that mourn for those who will not mourn for themselves,
verily they shall be comforted. Blessed are they who are enabled to
walk with GOD in a declining day;――they shall shine hereafter with a
distinguished lustre. Thus _Enoch_ did,――and _Enoch_ was remarkably
honoured.――“He was not, for GOD took him.”――But shall the harps of
_Boston_ Christians be always hanging on the willows? No; JESUS will
not be always chiding. He that has brought on this pleasant Spring,
after so hard a Winter, can thaw men’s hearts, and cause the turtle
once more to be heard in the land. Hasten that time, O blessed LORD!――I
hope you will keep close to your prayer-days. I have received the
memorials from dear Mr. _P――――_, and shall disperse them. I should
be glad of a line from him. How are his dear daughters, and the other
members of your society? I do not forget you, indeed I do not. If
affection guided me, you would soon see me; but the people in these
Southern parts are like people that have no shepherd. Surely I ought
to go out after them. To-day I have had a sweet season. People are very
ready to hear, and the word seems to fasten in some souls. Follow me
with your prayers. Remember me to your husband, and to all, in the most
cordial manner, and believe me to be

        Your very affectionate friend, and willing servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                                  _Dover, (Pensylvania) May 8, 1747._

_Honoured Madam_,

THE great though unmerited regard you have always been pleased to
express for me, emboldens me now and then to drop you a line to inform
you, that you are not forgotten by me before that GOD whose mercy
endureth for ever. I trust, your latter end, like that of _Job_’s, will
greatly increase, and that you will, as it is said of the righteous,
“Bring forth much fruit in old age.” Your honoured husband (to whom
be pleased to present my dutiful respects) I suppose is now with you.
The LORD hath honoured you with many honours, and I hope, amidst all
outward favours, does not withhold the comforting influences of his
blessed spirit from your soul. I have reason to believe, you esteem
this above all earthly things whatsoever. O, dear Madam! how mean and
contemptible does every creature appear, when the soul gets a near view
of a crucified Redeemer! How easy to bear pain, when one meditates on
the agony and bloody sweat of an incarnate GOD! Here then, honoured
madam, fix your eye. Look unto JESUS continually. He hath been the
author, he will be the finisher of your faith. I find him to be a
GOD that changeth not, a tender and compassionate High Priest. Thro’
his help, I continue to this day preaching amongst poor sinners the
unsearchable riches of his dying love, I am as well in health as I
can expect to be, and more and more determined to spend and be spent
for the good of precious and immortal souls. Through grace, my labours
are rendered very acceptable in various places. Be pleased, Madam, to
remember me before the throne. I neither forget you nor the General.――I
pray that GOD’s loving kindnesses and fatherly corrections may make you
truly great, and beg leave to subscribe myself, honoured Madam,

              Your affectionate, obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DLXXXVIII.


                        _To Mr. B――――, Senior._

                                                _Dover, May 8, 1747._

_Very dear Mr. B――――_,

I Think it is high time for me to send you a line of thanks, for the
favours you have been pleased to shew me, while others were loading
me with scorn and contempt. A weak body and continued employ in the
service of the best of Masters, occasion my not writing so frequently
to my dear friends, as love and gratitude would prompt me to do. You
will accept this unfeigned apology, and still increase the obligations
you have laid upon me, by continuing to remember me before the LORD.
I have need, great need of the united prayers of my christian friends.
――For JESUS hath of late so remarkably appeared for me, that I ought
to lay myself out more and more in going about endeavouring to do
good to precious and immortal souls. At present this is my settled
resolution. The Redeemer seems to approve of it; for the fields in the
Southern parts are white ready unto harvest, and many seem to have the
hearing ear. All next _October_, GOD willing, I have devoted to poor
_North-Carolina_. It is pleasant hunting in the woods after the lost
sheep for whom the Redeemer hath shed his precious blood. May the LORD
of the harvest spirit up more to go forth in his strength, to compel
poor sinners to come in! I hope that you and my other _Boston_ friends
do go in and out, and find good pasture. I hear it is a Winter time
with many. May GOD keep the fatal languor from extending to the circle
of my intimate friends! For alas, what is a christian without a holy
warmth? Will you remember me to all that you know, in the most tender
manner? I beseech them by the mercies of GOD, to live _near_ to JESU’s
cross, and whatever others may do, let them and theirs serve the LORD
CHRIST. You will remember me in particular to Mr. _F――――_, and his
family, Mr. _V――――_ and wife, your dear son, and your whole houshold,
as being, dear Sir,

     Your most affectionate, obliged friend and brother in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DLXXXIX.


                         _To Mr. H―――― S――――._

                                                _Dover, May 9, 1747._

AS you were my kind host and peculiar friend, I take the liberty of
writing to you more frequently than to others. I hope you will accept
of this as a token of my unfeigned gratitude and love. It brings you
the news of my being advanced thus far, of my being in health, and
employed in going about and preaching to poor sinners the unsearchable
riches of JESUS CHRIST. I shall be more northward, GOD willing, in
_June_, and possibly may stretch as far as some part of _New-England_.
――But I am not yet determined. Pray for me, dear Mr. _S――――_, that
JESUS may direct my steps. I would not willingly go to the right hand
or to the left, contrary to his blessed will, for ten thousand worlds.
――When shall I have another line from you? It may be directed to me
at _Philadelphia_. My dear yoke-fellow is there now. We travelled very
pleasantly through the woods, and purpose returning to _South-Carolina_
and _Georgia_ in the fall. We lead a moving life, but I trust we move
heaven-ward. O that JESUS may quicken all his dear people’s hearts, and
cause them to mount on wings like an eagle! I hear that times are yet
dead in _New-England_. It is dreadful to have winter all the year round.
May your heart, my dear Sir, and the heart of your dear wife, and the
hearts of all my dear friends, be kept close to JESUS, and continually
flaming with love! I know you will readily say _Amen_. For the present,
adieu. I must go to my delightful work, PREACHING. Pray remember me to
all. Let me have a line, and tell me whether the LORD stirs up any to
lend an helping hand to, very dear Mr. _S――――_,

                 Yours most affectionately in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER DXC.


                 _To the Reverend Mr. M――――, junior._

                                 _Dover in Pensylvania, May 9, 1747._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

EVER since I have known and heard of you, the LORD JESUS CHRIST hath
made you peculiarly dear to my soul. Your troubles and soul distresses
have in some measure been my own. I have looked and learned from
your case, that we are indeed but clay in the hands of the heavenly
potter, and that a sovereign GOD may deal with us as it seemeth good
in his sight. “His ways are in the deep waters, and his footsteps are
not known.” What he does to us now, we know not, but we shall know
hereafter. How will you be surprized, dear Sir, in a very short time,
to see that JESUS, whom your soul loves, and who has many a time shed
abroad his love in your heart; how will you be surprized to see him
receive you into glory, and turning your late or present _Egyptian_
darkness into celestial and eternal day? May the compassionate high
priest till then support your sinking spirits, and enable you to cope
with and overcome all those difficulties and temptations, which either
the prevalency of an inveterate melancholy, or the malice of evil
spirits, may make you the subject of! Satan hath desired to have you,
that he may sift you as wheat; but surely JESUS prays for you, though
as it were behind the curtain. Excuse this freedom, reverend Sir;
redeeming love constrains me to write thus. I hope you will receive
it, as it is written, in much love. If you enquire after me, I would
inform you that I am travelling about, and preaching from time to time
among poor sinners the unsearchable riches of JESUS CHRIST. I trust,
my labours are not in vain in the LORD. The glorious _Emmanuel_ has
given me a pleasant Winter, and I hope is about to cause these southern
wildernesses to blossom like a rose. You will follow me with your
prayers. My most humble and affectionate respects await your aged
father. My love to your nurse, and all _York_ friends. I am

              Yours most affectionately in JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DXCI.


                           _To Mrs. B――――._

                             _Wicoacommoco, (Maryland) May 16, 1747._

_Dear Mrs. B――――_,

HEARING by Captain _Adams_ that the glorious _Emmanuel_ holds your soul
in life, I cannot help letting you know, past kindnesses are not yet
forgotten, and that I wish you much spiritual and temporal prosperity.
How does your soul prosper in these hard, dull and afflicting times?
Has tribulation produced patience, patience experience, and experience
hope; and do you find thereby the love of GOD shed abroad in your
heart by the Holy Ghost? Happy then, unspeakably happy are you in being
afflicted. With exultation of heart may you sing,

                                _O happy rod!_
                  _That brought me nearer to my GOD._

I think I can say, it is good to bear the yoke of affliction in
youth. It teaches one to keep silence, and weans us from a too great
attachment to all sublunary enjoyments. I have a few strokes of my
father’s rod from time to time, as well as you. But I find that his rod
as well as his staff do comfort. I am a naughty child, and want much
correction; but he that wounds, heals also, and in glory we shall find,
that his loving correction hath made us great. O glory! It is yonder in
view; JESUS stands at the top of the ladder to receive us into it. Look
to him, dear Mrs. _B――――_, for surely he is your never-dying husband.
――Death itself shall not, death cannot part him and you. Had I strength
equal to my will, I should write much of the Redeemer’s everlasting
love; but my body is weak through continued journeyings and preaching.
However, CHRIST’s strength is in some degree magnified in my weakness,
and my preaching is blessed to poor souls. Amazing love! _Maryland_ is
yielding converts to the blessed JESUS. The gospel seems to be moving
southward. Pray for me, that I may be unwearied in well doing, and
follow the Lamb whithersoever he shall be pleased to lead me. Pray
remember me in the kindest manner to your aged declining pastor, the
other minister who lives about five miles from you, to Mr. _J――――_, and
all my kind nurses, and dear _York_ friends. I find death and sickness
have made great havock and alterations among them. May JESUS sanctify
all events to the furtherance of his grace, in all their hearts, and
give us to meet where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary
are at rest! I salute you and all, and once more praying that you and
yours may be watered by the blessed JESUS every ♦moment, I subscribe
myself, dear Mrs. _B――――_,

       Your most affectionate, obliged servant in JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._

    ♦ “momoment” replaced with “moment”




                             LETTER DXCII.


                  _To the Reverend Mr. J―――― R――――._

                                        _Wicoacommoca, May 16, 1747._

CAN souls united in JESUS’s love ever forget one another? It is
difficult, though I believe possible, and in dull seasons I fear too
common. However, blessed be the Redeemer, I have not yet forgotten my
dear Mr. _R――――_. As a proof it, I send you these few lines by Captain
_Adams_. You see whence they are dated. Methinks I see you rejoice,
and ready to say, “And have the _Marylanders_ also received the grace
of GOD?” I trust some have indeed received his grace in sincerity.
The harvest is promising.――The heat tries my wasting tabernacle, but,
through CHRIST strengthening me, I intend persisting till I drop. Since
I saw you, the glorious _Emmanuel_ has multiplied my obligations to
spend and be spent in his service a thousand-fold. The language of my
heart at present is,

              _A willing and a chearful mind,_
              _That life and all things cast behind,_
                _Springs forth obedient to thy call;_
              _A heart that no desire can move,_
              _But still to adore, believe and love,_
                _Give me, my CHRIST, my GOD, my all._

O dear Sir, continue to pray for me, that I may not flag in the latter
stages of my road. I was in hopes of seeing you this Summer, but am
afraid my engagements to preach in _North-Carolina_ next _October_
will prevent me. However, you and the other dear neighbouring ministers
are always upon my heart. I pity them in their present distressing
circumstances, and pray that they and you may have grace given to
endure hardness like good soldiers of JESUS CHRIST. Your dear father
I hear is discharged from all campaigns.――Ere long, the captain of our
salvation will command us home also. The LORD grant that we may die
like soldiers, fighting against the devil, the world, and the flesh.
How are your dear brothers and son? Pray give my hearty love to them,
and to your dear wife, and whole houshold. I salute you all from my
dear fellow pilgrim now at _Philadelphia_; and praying that you may
have thousands to be your joy and crown of rejoicing in the great day,
I subscribe myself, reverend and very dear Sir,

     Your very affectionate friend, brother and willing servant in
                             JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DXCIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. B――――._

                            _Near New-Town, (Maryland) May 21, 1747._

AND how does my dear friend and brother Mr. _B――――_ after so long a
silence? What a pity is it, that the Redeemer’s children cannot more
frequently correspond with each other? Blessed be GOD, there is a time
coming, when our fellowship with JESUS and one another shall never
be interrupted. Now is the time for stirring; then will be a time for
sitting, in no meaner place than (O amazing love!) at the right hand
of the everloving, everlovely Lamb of GOD.――Well then my dear man,
let us go on in his strength, and see what we can do for precious and
immortal souls. Indeed they are purchased with the blood of GOD. This
consideration excites me to persist in going out into the highways and
hedges.――I have been now a three hundred mile circuit in _Mary-land_,
and through one or two counties in _Pensilvania_. Every where people
have a hearing ear, and I trust some have an obedient heart. I hope
the time of singing of birds is come to _New-England_, and that your
hands are full of work. I most heartily wish you very much success. I
cordially salute your dear yoke-fellow, and all the followers of the
Lamb, and beg you would not forget, my dear old friend,

                           Your affectionate
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DXCIV.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. P――――._

                                            _New-Town, May 21, 1747._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

IT sometimes gives me concern that I cannot hear oftener from you, and
your dear son, whom I love so tenderly. But I suppose your hands are
full of work for the best of masters. I pray him daily, that you may
be crowned with much success. Though I have deserved a thousand and a
thousand times over to be cast off, yet such is the divine goodness,
that my labours in fresh places are made very acceptable daily. I have
now been upon the stretch, preaching constantly for almost three weeks.
I hope I can say with sincerity (O that I may say it with humility!)
that GOD hath been with me of a truth. My body is often extremely weak,
but the joy of the LORD is my strength, and by the help of my GOD I
intend going on till I drop, or this poor carcase can hold out no more.
These southern colonies lie in darkness, and yet, as far as I find,
are as willing to receive the gospel as others. If some books could be
purchased to dispose among poor people, much good might be done. Pray,
Sir, have you any Latin school-books to spare? I shall want some for
the Orphan-house. I hope to hear from you at _Philadelphia_, where I
expect to be in a week’s time. In the mean while, reverend Sir, I beg
you would make my most cordial and humble respects acceptable to all
your reverend brethren, that honoured me with their acquaintance, as
well as to your dear family and all other friends. I wish you and them
millions and millions of blessings, and intreat the continuance of
their and your prayers, for, reverend and very dear Sir,

     Your most affectionate, though unworthy younger brother, and
                          servant in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DXCV.


                         _To Mr. H―――― H――――._

                                        _Philadelphia, May 30, 1747._

_My dearest Brother_,

HAD I strength equal to my will, you should now receive from me a very
long letter; but at present I have such a fever upon me, that I can
scarce send you a few lines. However I will try. Your dear letters
in _August_ last came to my hands last Lord’s-day.――They variously
affected me, and put me on the search, whether I had neglected writing
to my very dear man. Upon enquiry, I found that I wrote to you about
the same time as I wrote to Mr. _J――――_, and brother _S――――_, and four
or five times since. Blessed be the GOD and Father of our LORD JESUS
CHRIST, I am not suffered to forget old love and old friends. Indeed
you are very dear to me,――all of you very dear to me still. I thank
you ten thousand times for all expressions of your tender love, and for
your steadiness in the truths and cause of CHRIST; and hope sometimes
that your prayers will draw me to _England_ more speedily than I
imagine. But what shall I say, my dear friend? Here are thousands and
thousands in _America_ who as to spiritual things know not their right
hand from their left; and who are ready to hear the gospel from my
mouth. Since my coming this time from _Georgia_, I have been within
these five weeks a circuit of 400 miles, and every where found the
fields white ready unto harvest. Nobody goes out scarcely but myself.
As you are in _England_ and _Wales_, the power of religion I trust will
be kept up; and though my coming should be delayed some time longer,
yet when I am sent, it will be with the greater blessing. I am daily
finishing my outward affairs, and shall think my call clearer home,
when I have provided for the support of the Orphan-house. The generous
benefactor’s letter pierced my heart, made me to shed tears of love,
and to put up many prayers for him. I sent him a letter from _Charles-
Town_ under cover to Mr. _B――――_. If the person be unknown, I see no
impropriety in printing my letter in the _Daily Advertiser_ or _Evening
Post_. I am glad you have printed my letter to the _Litchfield_ clergy,
and want to know what effect my sermon on the rebellion has had. Our
LORD has blessed it much in these parts. I shall be glad when the great
Head of the church unites dear brethren again. I trust nothing shall
be wanting on my part when I come over. An union before perhaps may not
be so well. However, I leave it to you, my dear Sir, and think that the
bar being taken away against people’s coming to the tabernacle, may be
one good step towards it. I wait upon the LORD. As his grace increases
in the heart, I am sure his children will grow less positive and more
child-like, yet more steady. O my dear man, I could write all night
long, but am so giddy by hard riding and preaching constantly in the
heat of the day, that I must defer being more particular till another
opportunity. I hope my dear wife will supply all my deficiencies.
Remember me in the tenderest manner to all. Bid them to pray me to
_England_; and in the mean while, they may assure themselves they are
not forgotten by, my very dear brother,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                                        _Philadelphia, June 1, 1747._

_My dear Mr. H――――_,

I Make no apology for troubling you with the inclosed. I hear you have
taken the Tabernacle outward affairs into your hands. I am glad of it,
and pray the LORD of all Lords to make you a faithful steward of his
manifold gifts. You will remember me most tenderly to dear Mrs. _H――――_,
and to all friends. Perhaps I may see you yet before I die. GOD is
delivering me out of my embarrassments by degrees. With the collection
made at _Charles-Town_, I have purchased a plantation and some slaves,
which I intend to devote to the use of _Bethesda_. When a sufficient
fund for the future support of that house is raised, so that it may not
lie as a dead weight upon me when absent, I shall think my call clearer
to _England_. At present I have full work here; the congregations
yesterday were exceeding large, and for this month past I have been
preaching to thousands in different places. I am sick and well, as I
used to be in _England_; but the Redeemer fills me with comfort, and
gives me to rejoice in his salvation day by day. I am determined in his
strength to die fighting, and to go on till I drop. He is a JESUS worth
dying for. Once more, remember us to all. We remember you, and am, as
much as as ever, dear Mr. _H――――_,

         Your affectionate friend, brother and willing servant
                              in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._

_Very dear Sir_,

YESTERDAY I received your very kind and judicious letter. In answer to
it, must inform you, that in all probability I shall once more see my
dear _New-England_ friends this summer. I suppose it will be some time
in _July_. At present my whole frame of nature seems to be shocked.――I
have had several returns of my convulsions, and have almost always a
continual burning fever. With great regret I have omitted preaching one
night (to oblige my friends,) and purpose to do so once more, that they
may not charge me with murdering myself; but I hope yet to die in the
pulpit, or soon after I come out of it. Dying is exceeding pleasant to
me: for the LORD, though my body is so weak, causes my soul to rejoice
exceedingly. Letters from _England_ refreshed me; all of them call me
home loudly. May JESUS direct my steps! I am poor and needy, but the
LORD I am persuaded will be my helper. Outward affairs when I am weak
pull me down; but the LORD can and will raise and keep me up.――I preach
here with great acceptance. Congregations are as large as ever. Next
_Monday_ sevennight I purpose, GOD willing, to set out for _New-York_.
I wrote lately from _New-Town_, to Messrs. _Prince_, _W――――_, _R――――_,
&c. but am apt to believe the packet has miscarried. I think to come by
way of _Long-Island_, and to return by _Connecticut_. You will not be
slack in getting all to pray for me, who am, very dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DXCVIII.


                            _To Mr. P――――._

                                        _Philadelphia, June 5, 1747._

_Very Dear Sir_,

THOUGH this frail nature of mine has lately received several very great
shocks, yet I cannot, if strength admits, omit writing you a line. Glad
was I when I came to town, to hear by Captain _G――――_ that you was so
far recovered, as to be able once more to go to the house of GOD. I
heartily wish you, dear Sir, what the noble Colonel _Gardiner_ once
wished me, “A thriving soul in a healthy body.” Or however it may be
with the one, I earnestly pray that the other may prosper. Sickness is
often made use of as a means, in the hands of an all-gracious Father,
to ripen our graces and fit us for heaven. Through grace, I can say it
is good for me to be sick, though I am afraid I am too impatient to be
gone. Well! He that cometh, will come, and cannot tarry long: till then
may I be resigned, and work the works of him that sent me whilst it is
day, before the night cometh when no man can work. I could proceed, but
indeed, dear Sir, strength faileth me. However, I hope to see you and
my other dear _Charles-Town_ friends in _November_. O that till then
we may every moment grow in grace and in the knowledge of JESUS CHRIST.
I would write to many, but weakness forbids. I must refer you to Mr.
_S――――_ for particulars concerning me. My dear yoke-fellow joins in
sending cordial respects to yourself and all friends. Neither you nor
they are forgotten by, very dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                                        _Philadelphia, June 6, 1747._

_My very dear Friend_,

I Love you dearly, and therefore must, though in much weakness, send
you a line. It informs you of my being sick, but withal of the LORD’s
comforting me, and causing me to triumph over the king of terrors.
Mr. _B――――_ I suppose, ere this reaches you, will let you know that
the word has run, and hath been glorified in _Mary-land_. Satan has
attempted to stop the progress of the everlasting gospel in _Virginia_;
but I believe he has overshot himself. How can it be otherwise? since
eternal Truth hath said, “The seed of the woman shall bruise the
serpent’s head.” I hope you find this true, by the daily conquest you
get over the corruptions of your heart. Remember who hath promised to
make you more than conqueror through his love. Our kind respects attend
dear Mrs. _B――――_, your son, and daughter, and all friends. O that
we may meet grown in grace, and the knowledge of our LORD and Saviour
JESUS CHRIST. I subscribe myself, very dear Mr. _B――――_,

                 Yours most affectionately in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER DC.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. S――――._

                                       _Philadelphia, June 23, 1747._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

SINCE my last, I have been several times on the verge of eternity.
To-day I have got a few more spirits. I would improve them in answering
your kind letter, which I received yesterday. I am obliged to _Charles-
Town_ friends: their example will certainly influence many here.
Something is upon the anvil. Particulars expect in my next. To-morrow,
GOD willing, I set out for _New-York_, to see if I can gain strength.
At present I am so weak, that I cannot preach.――’Tis hard work to be
silent; but I must be tried every way. Friends are exceeding kind. What
is the best of all, the friend of sinners looks in upon, and comforts
my heart. I have had loud calls to _England_. Matters go on bravely
there and in _Wales_. My _State Sermon_ has gone through two editions.
They have also my five last sermons, which have convinced my friends
that I am firm to my principles. May JESUS keep me steady till I die!
I am glad Mr. _P――――_ went off so well. His children I look upon as my
own. The things which he had belong to me. I would have them taken to
_Providence_: for that also _Deus providebit_. Your father is well, and
always talking of you. Why did you not mention his wife in your letter?
She is a discreet woman, and desired to be remembered to you. Every day
she expects to lie in. You will excuse my enlarging.――Strength begins
to fail me. However, whilst I have strength I would employ it in
praying for you and yours. I subscribe myself, reverend and very dear
Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER DCI.


                            _To Mr. R――――._

                                           _New-York, June 28, 1747._

_My dear Brother_,

THANKS be to GOD, for revealing his dear Son in you. Thanks be to his
great name for calling you to preach his everlasting gospel. I give him
all the glory, and adore him for making ill and hell-deserving me, the
happy instrument of alarming and awakening your dead soul. Ere long I
hope we shall meet in eternity, to sing endless praises to him who has
redeemed us unto GOD by his blood, and has made us kings and priests
unto GOD, and enables us to reign over death, hell, and sin, even
whilst here on earth. I abhor all those bad principles which you
mention, and cannot join so as to labour in the same place, and upon
the same plan, with those that hold them. However, let us behave with
meekness, my dear brother, and we shall soon find that every plant that
our heavenly father hath not planted, shall be plucked up. “He that
believeth doth not make haste.” JESUS reigneth; let our eyes wait on
Him. All things shall work, and even now are working, together for good
to all that love him. In due time you will see me, perhaps next year. I
am as willing to hunt for souls as ever. I am not weary of my master or
his work, though he might long ago have been weary of me. But his name
is Love. Proclaim it, my dear Sir, proclaim it till thou diest. By the
strength of GOD I will. My love to all. I can now write no more, being
recovered from a great illness. Continue to pray over

       Your affectionate friend, brother and servant in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCII.


                            _To Dr. B――――._

                                           _New-York, June 29, 1747._

_Dear Sir_,

SINCE I wrote to Doctor _S――――_, I have preached to a very large
auditory, and, blessed be GOD, do not find myself much worse for it
this morning. As I am bound to thank you for all favours, so especially
would I send my acknowledgments for promoting this northward excursion.
I believe it will be a great means of restoring my health, which I
value upon no other account, than as it renders me more capable of
doing good to mankind. A pleasing prospect of action lies before me.
I am willing once more, in the strength of JESUS of _Nazareth_, to
enter the field, and hope through his blessing, I shall return to
_Philadelphia_ laden with fresh experiences of unwearied and redeeming
love. Whether I shall leave _New-York_ this week is uncertain. But
wherever I am, assure yourself, dear Sir, your favours shall not be
forgotten. That the great physician of souls may bless you and yours
with the choicest of his mercies, is and shall be the hearty prayer of,
dear Sir,

                   Your most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCIII.


                              _To ――――._

                                           _New-York, June 29, 1747._

_My very dear, dear Brother_,

IT is with much pleasure I now sit down to answer your kind and
welcome letters, dated _April_ 11th and 13th. And to keep you no longer
in suspence, I would inform you, that they have had such an effect
upon me, that, GOD willing, I am determined to embark for _England_
or _Scotland_ early next Spring.――’Till _Christmas_ I am already
under indissoluble engagements, and am making a strong effort, in
dependance on the great Head of the church, to get free from my outward
embarrassments.――I thank my dear _English_ friends for what they have
done for me in this respect, and must beg you, my dear and faithful
brother, still to do what you can further. The LORD JESUS seems _to
assure me_ that the time of my deliverance is at hand.――I hope before
this year is out, to stock my new plantation in _South-Carolina_ as
a _visible fund_ for the _Orphan-house_, and upon news of something
more being done in _England_, (so that my poor heart may no more be
oppressed as it has been for many years by outward difficulties,) my
answer shall be, Lo! I come once more to see my dear, very dear friends
on the other side of the mighty waters. ’Till then, I shall as it
were count the hours, and long for them to glide away a-pace. My dear
yoke-fellow now at _Philadelphia_ is like-minded, being exceedingly
desirous to see her dear friends once more. May JESUS grant it, if it
be agreeable to his holy will! Indeed, I have lately thought I should
never see you any more. For some weeks past, I have been exceedingly
indisposed. GOD has been pleased to bring my body to the very brink of
the grave by convulsions, gravel, a nervous cholic, and a violent fever.
But as pain and afflictions abounded, consolations much more abounded,
and my soul longed to take its flight to JESUS. For this week past I
have not preached; but since my leaving _Philadelphia_, about three
days ago, I seemed to have gathered strength, and hope once more,
to-morrow, to proclaim amongst poor sinners the unsearchable riches
of JESUS CHRIST. From hence I purpose to go to _Boston_, and return by
land so as to reach _Charles-Town_ by _November_.――Glad shall I be to
receive an answer to this, about that time there.――For upon that in a
great measure will depend my coming to you, or staying longer in these
parts. Blessed be the LORD of all Lords, the door is yet open here,
and I am exceedingly rejoiced to find it is kept so sweetly open at
home. I can easily guess how my dear man has been tried. I find more
and more that through much tribulation we must enter into glory, and
by sufferings be prepared for farther usefulness here below.――O that
patience may have its perfect work in our hearts. O that underneath
thee may be the everlasting arms, and that by happy experience thou
mayst daily prove the strength of JESUS to be thine. I intend, GOD
willing, to write to brother _J――――_, &c. I rejoice that brother
_E――――_ still continues in his place.――It is a token for good. You
will return my most humble and dutiful respects to good Lady _H――g――n_,
the Marquiss, and Mrs. _E――――n_. If possible I will write to them.――I
sent letters to the Marquiss, Lord _L――――n_, and Lord _R――――a_, about
_October_ last, but suppose they have miscarried.――I leave my affairs
to you, and depend on you, under GOD, to transact them all.――The
trouble is great, but JESUS will support and reward thee.――Near forty
pounds yearly were subscribed in _England_ to the _Orphan-house_, but
I have not received I think above five.――I have rather more confidence
in you, if possible, my very dear Man, than ever. May JESUS reward
thee for all thy works of faith, and labours which have proceeded of
love!――I wish you joy of your little one, and most heartily salute your
dear wife, and all the lovers of the blessed JESUS every where. I wrote
to you about a month ago in extreme weakness, and shall neglect no
opportunity of sending to you.――I beseech you to continue to pray me
over, and assure yourself none of you are forgotten by, my very dear
Brother,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCIV.

                                            _New-York, July 4, 1747._

_Rev. and very dear Sir_,

LAST week I left a letter for you at _Philadelphia_.――Since that,
through the divine blessing, I have recovered a little more strength,
and find my appetite restored. I have been here about eight days, and
to-morrow, GOD willing, intend posting away to _Boston_, and then I
shall take a long, if not a final farewel of all my northward friends.
I have preached twice with great freedom. People flock rather more
than ever, and the LORD vouchsafes us solemn meetings. I hope to
be back again in six weeks. I shall go, if JESUS gives strength, like
an arrow out of a bow. I have therefore left my dear yoke-fellow at
_Philadelphia_, and expect to meet her again at _New-York_. Among these
three northward provinces, I trust something considerable will be done
towards paying off the orphan-house arrears. When that is effected, I
care not how soon I sing my _Nunc dimittis_; but I must wait ’till my
blessed change come. You will be pleased to remember me to all, and you
may expect, GOD willing, at the appointed time, Reverend and very dear
Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Brother A――――_,

I Have just now been reading over your kind letter, dated _November_
23d, the second or third time.――It affected me much; and with the other
letters, have constrained me to set my face towards _England_.――What is
due in _America_, for the _Orphan-house_, I hope to discharge this year.
――I am of your mind in respect to the work in _England_, and therefore
am willing so to settle my affairs, that when I come over, I may stay
with you for a long season, if the LORD JESUS is pleased to give me
health and strength.――At present I am very weakly, and scarce able to
preach above once or twice a week.――But if our Saviour hath further
work for me to do, he can make me young and strong as an eagle.――If not,
I shall go to him whom my soul loveth, and whom I long to see.――Blessed
be his Name that there are yet a few names left in _Sardis_, that have
not defiled their garments, but have kept close to his truths and cause
in this declining day.――――You will remember me to all most tenderly.――I
pray for you continually, and whilst I am writing, it being _Friday_¹,
comfort myself with this consideration, that many are praying for me.
――You will see my letter to dear brother _H――――_, and excuse my being
so short, because I am so weak.――Our LORD continues to deal graciously
with me, and was I well, I have rather a wider door than ever opened
before me.――But our thoughts are not as his thoughts.――For the present,
adieu.――I send most cordial love to you, yours, and all, and am, more
than ever,

                   Yours, &c. in the blessed JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

_My dear John_,

THOUGH I am quite sick and weak in body, yet the love I owe thee for
JESU’s sake, constrains me to answer your last kind letter, dated
_♦February_ 5th. The other mentioned therein, never came to hand. I am
sorry to hear there are yet disputings amongst us about brick-walls.
I was in hopes, after our contests of that kind about seven years ago,
such a scene would never appear again; but I find fresh offences must
come, to search out and discover to us fresh corruptions, to try our
faith, teach us to cease from man, and to lean more upon him, who by
his infinite wisdom and power will cause, “that out of the eater shall
come forth meat, and from the strong sweetness.” I am glad you find
yourself happy in the holy JESUS. I wish thee an increase of such
dear-bought happiness every day, and pray that thy mouth may not be
stopped, as others have been before thee, from publishing the glad
tidings of salvation, by a crucified Redeemer. It has been thy meat
and drink to preach among poor sinners the unsearchable riches of JESUS
CHRIST. May’st thou continue and abide in this plan, and whether I see
thee or not, whether thou dost ever think of, or write to me any more,
I wish thee much success, and shall always pray that the work of the
LORD may prosper in thy hands. Whether you have changed your principles
with your situation, I know not. I would only caution thee against
taking any thing for _gospel_ upon the mere authority of man. Go where
thou wilt, though thou shouldest be in the purest society under heaven,
thou wilt find that the best of men are but men at the best, and will
meet with stumbling blocks enough, to teach thee the necessity of a
continual dependence on the LORD JESUS, who alone is infallible, and
who will not give that glory to another. Blessed be his Name, for the
trials I have met with from the friends of _Zion_. At present, I can
rejoice in being deserted by one, and used unkind by another, who at
the great day must own me to be their spiritual father. Such trials are
very salutary.――They lead me to the Cross, and I trust in the end will
conform me to him, who in his bitterest agony had no one to watch with
him, no not for one hour. My dear man, you will excuse me, as my heart
at present is affected with the thoughts of the divisions that subsist
between the servants and churches of JESUS CHRIST. May JESUS heal them,
and hasten that blessed time, when we shall all see eye to eye, and
there shall be no disputings about houses, doctrine, or discipline in
all GOD’s holy mountain! GOD willing, I purpose seeing _England_ next
year, and shall be glad to converse with thee once more, about the
things which belong to our Saviour’s kingdom.――If my present sickness
ends in death, we shall converse in a better world, and without the
least discord and contention. Remember me to _Brampton_, and to all. I
thank them for not forgetting the chief of sinners. Tell them JESUS is
yet with me, and causes my rod to bud and blossom. The bush burns, but
is not consumed. Adieu.

                   Thine in the glorious _Emmanuel_,

_Dear Madam_,

I Hope that since I left you, Mr. _M――――_’s conversation has been
blessed, and that you are steadily and deliberately resolved to know
nothing but JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified. Indeed he is the fairest
among ten thousand. The more you know him, the more you will love him.
O what a happy change will you experience when you enter into the world
of new creatures! May JESUS hasten the time, and enable you to come
as a poor, lost, undone sinner, to be clothed with his everlasting
righteousness! Accept these few hasty lines. They are the language of a
heart truly concerned for your eternal welfare. I salute Miss _M――――_;
may JESUS make her a wise virgin, and give you and dear Mr. _R――――_
grace to bring her up in the nurture and admonition of the LORD! I at
present add no more. As opportunity offers, you shall hear again from
me. Dear Madam,

         Your affectionate friend and servant for CHRIST sake,
                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Madam_,

DOES not JESUS take his lambs into his arms, and dandle his little ones
on his knees? Ought not his ministers then to follow his good example,
and strive with him, not to quench the smoaking flax or break the
bruised reed. This consideration causes me to write you a few lines.
May they find you as in an agony to enter in at the straight gate!
Courage, dear Mrs. _L――――_, courage. CHRIST, heaven, glory, are worth
your acceptance. They are all yours, if you will give him your heart.
May JESUS make you willing, and enable you to say henceforward, “GOD
forbid that I should glory, save in the Cross of JESUS CHRIST.” You
will remember me to Mr. _L――――_, and all dear friends. As opportunity
offers, they and you shall hear from, dear Madam,

         Your most affectionate friend and willing servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                                         _New-York, August 27, 1747._

_Dear Mr. D――――_,

IS it not just, that I should pay off my old debts? consequently I
must write to you. I owe you many letters, and more love. Accept this
in part of payment. It brings you news of my safe arrival, through
the good hand of my GOD upon me, at _New-York_. We were detained upon
the water three or four days. I believe it was for good; for the LORD
blessed it to the recovery of my health, so that I eat like a sailor.
At present I find my nature recruited considerably, and met my dear
yoke-fellow and friends well at this place. O that my heart glowed with
thanks to the LORD of all Lords, whose mercy endureth for ever! Help
me, my dear Sir, to be thankful. My obligations to my glorious JESUS
are increased by my late excursion to _Charles-Town_, _Portsmouth_,
_Boston_, and other places in _New-England_. If I forget her, let my
right-hand forget her cunning. I think of, and pray for you and yours,
and all my dear friends daily. O let us so live, that we may meet in
heaven. You know the way; “JESUS is the way, the truth and the life.”
Walk before him, look continually to him, and you shall be enabled
to trample upon sin, death, and hell. Excuse the brevity of this.
Next time, GOD willing, you shall have a longer letter. My tender
love awaits your dear spouse and family. You will remember me to all
enquiring friends, and as GOD enables, you shall all be remembered by,
dear Mr. _D――――_,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER DCX.


                            _To Mr. A――――._

                                           _New-York, Aug. 27, 1747._

TO convince you that I remember your desire when at _Boston_, I send
you almost my first letter. It comes full of thanks for all past
favours. May the GOD whom I serve, reward you ten thousand fold! He
will, he has promised, he also will do it. Will you give me leave to
ask one favour more? You may guess what it is. I beseech you to entreat
the giver of every good and perfect gift to grant me an humble and a
thankful heart; for indeed, mercies are renewed to me every moment. GOD
has given me a pleasant journey, and brought me this day to _New-York_
in safety. My health is considerably restored, and I know not why my
dear friends yet cruelly hinder me. Well, GOD’s will be done! O that it
may be to the Redeemer’s glory, and the good of precious and immortal
souls! I am of the same mind as when at _Boston_,――resolved to preach
and work for JESUS, ’till I can preach and work no more. I doubt not,
but in your sphere, you are like-minded. May the LORD strengthen,
stablish, settle you in it, and give you to abound in every good word
and work. CHRIST is a good Master: he is worthy of all our time, and
of every thing that we possess. Is not one heart too little for him?
And yet he requires no more. Amazing love! I am lost when I think of
it. I can only say, LORD, I adore and worship! But how does dear Mrs.
_A――――_? Bid her, not be faithless, but believing. JESUS shall do more
for her than she can ask or think. I salute you both most heartily,
as does my dear yoke-fellow.――That JESUS may plentifully reward you
for all favours, and give you so to live here, that you may sit at
his right-hand eternally hereafter, is the hearty prayer of, dear Mr.
_A――――_,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCXI.


                    _To Mr. W――――, at Portsmouth._

                                           _New-York, Aug. 27, 1747._

_Very dear Sir_,

IS it right when we have committed a fault, to persist in, and not
confess and amend it? By no means. I must therefore write to you,
whom (though you have received no letter from me) I dearly love in the
bowels of the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS. I thank you, dear Sir,
for all favours, and exhort you, as the best return I can make, to walk
worthy of that GOD, who has called you to his kingdom and his glory.
May you be enabled to live above, and overcome the world! O that JESUS
may be at all times, your only All! O that you may look up continually
to him for light, life, and every thing! Then will he direct your steps,
and cause every change and scene of life to be a means of changing and
transforming your dear soul more and more into his own divine likeness.
You are shortly to enter into a new and untried state. Dear Sir, call
JESUS and his Disciples to your marriage; marry in and for the LORD,
or your life will be exceedingly uneasy and miserable. Remember, that
new states call for new strength. Let your eyes then be fixed on JESUS.
From him every good and perfect gift cometh. He alone can teach you to
use the world, and every worldly enjoyment, so as not to abuse it. I
commend you to his tender mercy. I pray continually for you, and humbly
intreat you to remember unworthy, ungrateful, ill and hell-deserving
me. I can now only most heartily thank you for all favours, beg to be
remembered to all friends, and subscribe myself, dear Sir,

                  Yours in Him that liveth for ever,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCXII.


                      _To the Rev. Mr. G. T――――._

                                           _New-York, Aug. 29, 1747._

_Rev. and very dear Sir_,

NOT want of love, but of leisure, has prevented my writing to you for
some time past. Blessed be GOD, I can now send you good news from the
Northward. My reception at _Boston_, and elsewhere in _New-England_,
was like unto the first. Arrows of conviction fled and stuck fast. Many,
I hear, were wounded. Congregations were rather larger than ever, and
opposers mouths were stopped. Will you now take another trip? I believe
it would be blest to the good of your own and many other souls. I would
be more particular, did I not expect to see you next week. I am better
in health than when I left _New-York_. GOD gives me grace to spend
it to the utmost in the Redeemer’s service. I am determined in his
strength, to die fighting, though it be upon my stumps. I trust you
pray for me. I remember you and your flock. I salute all tenderly, and
am, Rev. and very dear Sir,

         Your most affectionate younger brother and servant in
                             JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXIII.


                     _To Mr. Henry S――――, Junior._

                                           _New-York, Aug. 29, 1747._

_My dear Mr. S――――_,

LAST _Thursday_ noon the keeper of _Israel_, who neither slumbereth
or sleepeth, brought me hither in safety. We were detained three days
on the water. It was over-ruled for good. I recovered my appetite,
and am now much better than when I left _New-England_. Next _Tuesday_,
GOD willing, I shall set forward, and hope to be at _Charles-Town_ the
beginning of _November_. Will you write to me? GOD willing, you shall
hear from me every opportunity. I have good news from _Providence_, my
plantation in _South-Carolina_, and from _Bethesda_: both families are
well, and several negroes are under conviction. I hope those that were
under concern at _Portsmouth_, find their convictions to abide. I pray
GOD, they may have no rest, ’till they find rest in JESUS CHRIST! I
salute them, and all the Redeemer’s true followers. I join with my dear
yoke-fellow, in sending you, and dear Mrs. _S――――_, ten thousand thanks
for all favours, and am, very dear Sir,

        Your most affectionate, obliged friend and brother, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCXIV.


                            _To Mr. D――――._

                                           _New-York, Aug. 30, 1747._

MY dear brother _Daniel_, thou man greatly beloved, why weepest thou?
Why art thou so cast down? All is forgiven, all is forgotten long ago;
be strong, and GOD shall establish thy heart. Look up, and put thy
trust in the LORD. He is a merciful Redeemer; otherwise what could
worthless, ungrateful, unfruitful, ill, hell-deserving I do? O how
great is his love to us-ward! How kindly hath he brought me to
_New-York_! Pray let your mourning be turned into praise, and give
thanks to the LORD of all lords in behalf of your unworthy friend. You
are my old friend. I have loved thee, and do love thee with a peculiar
love. May the LORD increase thee more and more, even thee and thy
children! I send you and yours most cordial salutations. We set out,
GOD willing, to-morrow on our southern journey. I have good news from
the Orphan-house, and my new Plantation. Some negroes are brought under
conviction. Mr. _B――――_ was well the latter end of _July_. I shall take
care of his father’s letter. My dear yoke-fellow intends writing to you
soon. In the mean while accept hearty love from, yours as usual,

                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCXV.


                     _To Mrs. S――――, at New-York._

                                       _Philadelphia, Sept. 6, 1747._

SHALL I promise and not perform? GOD forbid. I must then drop a line to
my afflicted friend. How is your little one? Is it yet languishing? Is
it quite emaciated and panting for breath? Or is it gone into the world
of spirits? Whatever be your answer, I am ready to reply, Remember your
father _Abraham_; how chearfully did he offer up his dear _Isaac_, his
son, whom he loved? How kindly did the LORD take it at his hands? Go
thou and do likewise. If JESUS hath restored it to you, nurse it for
him; pray to him continually for grace to order it aright, and learn
how soon GOD may imbitter the dearest comforts to us. Happy, happy they,
who can lean on and trust in JESUS, whilst they are going through this
howling wilderness, this world of woe. I trust you are one of these
happy ones. O free grace! Sovereign, electing, distinguishing love! You
will join with me in saying, “Why me, LORD, why me?” I could enlarge.
Whilst I am writing, the fire kindles; but my Master’s business calls
me away. He is with me here. Remember the Pilgrims. My dear yoke-fellow
is gone forward; perhaps I may follow this week. I desire to be
remembered in the kindest manner to dear Mr. _S―――― P――――_, wife, and
all friends. I thank them and you a thousand times for all favours, and
am, dear Mrs. _S――――_,

       Your affectionate and willing servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCXVI.


                          _To Captain S――――._

                                       _Philadelphia, Sept. 9, 1747._

_My very dear Mr. S――――_,

THOUGH I wrote to you lately by my friend Mr. _V――――_, yet the receipt
of your kind letter makes me to write again. The deadly blow I see
is given. Well! Thanks be to GOD, you are so resigned. You doubtless
remember, that you took one another only “’till death you should part.”
That _shocking clause_, as Mr. _B――――_ calls it, is very instructive.
Blessed be GOD, that she gave you any comfortable evidences of her
being for ever with the LORD. If so, do not wish her here again, but
remember how soon your own great change must necessarily come. You are
now on the decline of life. You have seen that all below is vanity. O
that you may bring forth much fruit in old age! Take heed, watch and be
sober, since you know not at what hour the blessed bridegroom may come
to call you. I write thus freely to you; because you are pleased to
stile me your father. Pray for me then, that I may give to JESUS all
the glory, and study to glorify him more and more. Next _Monday_,
GOD willing, I intend leaving this place. Be pleased to acquaint our
dear friend Mr. _V――――_ that I intend writing to him soon. I hope he
reached home in safety. I salute him, Mr. _P――――_, and all friends most
heartily. Accept of the same yourself, in the most cordial manner, from,
very dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

                                       _Philadelphia, Sept. 9, 1747._

_Very dear Sir_,

LAST night I heard of Dr. _Coleman_’s sudden death. I bless GOD for
granting him such an easy passage. Soon after the news reached me, I
bowed my knee before the GOD and Father of our LORD JESUS in behalf
of your bereaved (and I could almost say desolate) church. O may the
LORD of all lords direct you in the choice of another, who may rule
and feed you diligently with all his power. I shall be glad to hear
what the great head of the church does for you. You may direct to me at
_Charles-Town_. GOD willing, I set forward on my journey _Monday_ next.
Our glorious _Emmanuel_ has been pleased to open my mouth, and enlarge
my heart in preaching the unsearchable riches of his grace,――I hope my
dear _Boston_ friends are warm and lively. I salute all most heartily.
Pray remember the poor pilgrims; and if you write to _Scotland_ or
_South-Carolina_, let them know how affairs go. My dear yoke-fellow is
gone to _Bohemia_, otherwise she would write. I intend writing to dear
Mr. _S――――_ by next post. In the mean while, I beg leave to subscribe
myself, very dear Sir,

                 Yours most affectionately in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXVIII.


                       _To Mr. and Mrs. F――――._

                                       _Philadelphia, Sept. 9, 1747._

_My very dear, dear Friends_,

THOUGH I hope to see you ere this reaches _Charles-town_, yet I cannot
but embrace every opportunity that offers to let you know how we do. I
have lately been eleven hundred miles journey northward, and have found
the Redeemer’s strength magnified in my great weakness. The word ran
and was glorified. I am now posting towards, and hope to reach you the
beginning of _November_ next. I am better in health than usual, and
through grace am determined to die fighting the Redeemer’s battles.
On _Long Island_ I saw Mr. _B――――_. He still loves his _Charles-Town_
friend. If you are not provided, it is my opinion, that it is best
for you, for him, and the church of CHRIST, that he should be at
_Charles-Town_. But this is only my opinion. With this, you will
receive a packet of letters from him. If it be not done before you
receive this, I wish you would be pleased to send my bureau, with
my other things that were packed up, to _Providence_. I would not
willingly have it to do when I come to _Charles-Town_. I hear you have
had a dry season, I trust it has not been so in spirituals. O that
JESUS may water you every moment! I think you may plead this promise
before a prayer-hearing GOD; “He that watereth, shall be water’d again.”
Surely the bowels of the saints have been, and are daily refreshed
through your means. Happy ye that are determined to make to yourselves
friends of the mammon of unrighteousness. When natural lives fail, you
shall be received into everlasting habitations. O happy time, when we
shall be, soul and body, for ever with the LORD! I have lived in hopes
some time, that my departure was at hand; but I seem to be gathering
strength again, and trust shall be made instrumental in calling some
more souls to the precious JESUS. O that I may be humble and thankful!
Dear friends, pray for us.――My dear wife is gone to _Bohemia_,
otherwise she would write. We have written by every ship. Some of our
letters, I believe, have been taken. Our tender love to all. I am,

                          Ever yours, whilst
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCXIX.

                                       _Philadelphia, Sept. 9, 1747._

_My very dear Mr. H――――_,

I Thank our gracious GOD for all the good news contained in your kind
letter. It ♦gladdened my heart, and gave me reason to hope, that the
_Indian_ land would be a christian land indeed. When I received your
letter, I was just returned from an eleven hundred miles journey
northward, in which the rock of ages was pleased to let much of his
glory pass before his dear people. I was enabled to preach about 30
times in _New-England_, and am now coming forward towards you, and hope
to see you in _November_. My dear yoke-fellow would answer Mrs. _H――――_,
but she is gone to _Bohemia_. Accept thanks and love in her name. I
have been frequently at the gates of death within these few months,
and thought to have reached my desired port; but it seems I must put
out to sea again. My heavenly Father’s will be done. I have good news
from _England_. I have some thoughts of seeing it next year. JESUS will
direct me. Captain _Grant_ is sailed from _Jamaica_. Ere long I hope
to owe no man any thing but love. Something considerable hath been done
since I left _Charles-Town_. The LORD will never fail those that put
their trust in him. I have remembered the book with the hymn tunes. I
hope we shall not differ about an earthly matter. We are brethren; let
us dwell in unity, and the GOD of love and peace will dwell amongst us.
O that his divine love may be shed abroad abundantly in our hearts by
the Holy Ghost! How shall we then bear with, and forbear one another?
I hope all around you are well, and watered with spiritual as well as
natural rain. I salute all most tenderly; and hoping to see you shortly,
I subscribe myself, very dear Mr. _H――――_,

                 Yours most affectionately in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

I Suppose, ere this comes to hand, you will have heard how near I have
been to my wished-for harbour, and how I have been obliged to put out
to sea again. Blessed be GOD, since I must live, he does not permit
me altogether to live in vain. The word ran and was glorified much in
_New-England_. The gathering of the people, and the power that attended
the word seemed to be near the same as when the work begun seven years
ago. I parted from my friends with great reluctance. Since my coming
southward, I have seen and dined with Governor _B――――_. He ♦still
retains his former affection, and I hope will be a great blessing to
these parts. I have lately heard of the death of Doctor _Coleman_. I
pity his poor congregation, fearing it will much dwindle. There are now
many destitute flocks in _New-England_. Mr. _B――――_’s death hath taught
me a good lesson. May the LORD JESUS keep me from trimming! something
considerable hath been done since I saw you, towards easing me of my
Orphan-house embarrassments. The particulars expect in _November_:
then I hope to see you once more. I still intend, GOD willing, to
see _Bermudas_. Blessed be GOD, I have good news from _Bethesda_ and
_Providence_. I am helped here, as I was at _New-York_, in preaching;
but find little conviction-work going on. As you observe, “that is
GOD’s work.” I hope you have been carried comfortably through the
Summer’s heat, and that we shall have a warm Winter when we meet at
_Charles-Town_. Your father’s child is dead. I have a letter for you
from him. I salute you and all for my dear yoke-fellow, who is gone
forward to _Bohemia_. I follow on _Monday_ next. You will remember
me in the kindest manner to all. I have written to many friends, but
believe the vessels have been taken in which the letters were sent.
I have now just time to beg the continuance of your prayers, and
subscribe myself, Rev. and very dear Sir,

                            Yours as usual,
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Brother_,

I Wrote to you within these few months from this place, _Boston_ and
_New-York_. My last letters were to inform you, that, GOD willing, some
time next year I purpose to see _England_, if my outward affairs can
be settled. Surely the LORD will deliver me from money matters by and
by.――He will, he will.――LORD, I believe, help my unbelief! I have good
news from _Georgia_, and from my new plantation in _South-Carolina_.
Many negroes are brought under conviction. We saw great things in
_New-England_. The flocking and power that attended the word, was like
unto that seven years ago. Weak as I was, and have been, I was enabled
to travel eleven hundred miles and preach daily. I am now once more
going to _Georgia_ to settle all my affairs, and shall get ready to
embark as soon as I receive letters from you. My dear yoke-fellow is
gone forwards. She exceedingly longs to see her old friends. But death
may intervene. I have been daily waiting for it. Few have expected my
life, but at present I seem to be getting strength. By the grace of
GOD, it shall all be employed in the dear Redeemer’s service. I find
no inclination to settle. My Heart (O free grace!) is yet springing
for GOD, and I am determined to die fighting. I hope matters go on
well with you. Indeed I remember you daily, and pray that you all may
be filled with all the fulness of GOD. I am here travelling through
a wilderness; but I trust leaning on my beloved. JESUS is my rock,
my stay, my GOD, and my all. Various are the scenes I pass through;
various are the comforts and supports I meet with. Sometimes the LORD
feeds me as it were by the ravens, and teaches me daily that man’s
extremity is his opportunity to help and succour. O, my dear brother,
if ever we meet in this world, how much have we to say to one another,
concerning the loving-kindnesses of the LORD? But when we meet in
heaven.――I am lost at the thought――What!

              _Make slaves the partners of thy throne,_
              _Decked with a never-fading crown?_

O JESUS! thy love is indeed immense, unsearchable.――Shed it abroad in
the dear man’s heart to whom I am writing, and the hearts of all with
whom he is concerned, and the hearts of all thy dear children. Even
so, LORD JESUS. Amen! I can no more. My heart is almost too full to

                                      _Philadelphia, Sept. 11, 1747._

_Dear and Rev. Sir_,

NOT long ago I received your kind letter, dated in _February_ last.
Your others I believe came to hand, and I hope ere now you have
received my answer. My heart is really for an outward, as well as an
inward union. Nothing shall be wanting on my part to bring it about;
but I cannot see how it can possibly be effected, ’till we all think
and speak the same things. I rejoice to hear, that you and your brother
are more moderate with respect to _sinless perfection_. Time and
experience I believe will convince you, that attaining such a state
in this life, is not a doctrine of the everlasting gospel. As for
_universal redemption_, if we omit on each side the talking for or
against reprobation, which we may do fairly, and agree as we already
do in giving an universal offer to all poor sinners that will come and
taste of the water of life, I think we may manage very well. But it is
difficult to determine such matters at a distance. Some time next year,
(if the Redeemer spares my life) I hope to see you face to face. In the
mean while, the language of my heart is,

                _O let us find the ancient way,_
                  _Our wond’ring foes to move;_
                _And force the heathen world to say,_
                  _See how these brethren love._

I rejoice to find that the rebellion has been over-ruled for the
awakening of many souls. Our LORD generally builds his temple in
troublesome times. I cannot, upon the maturest deliberation, charge
myself with a design to flatter in my sermon on that occasion. You know
my attachment to the present establishment. Out of the fulness of my
heart my pen wrote. But it may be I know not myself. LORD, keep me
from trimming! At present, my heart seems as free for JESUS as ever. I
have been once more in _New-England_. My entrance was as at the first,
about seven years ago. Perhaps I may embark from thence for my native
country. Our LORD will direct. I am now going to _Georgia_ to winter.
At _New-York_ and here, JESUS has enlarged my heart, and opened my
mouth to shew forth his praise. I have news of the awakening of several
negroes at my new plantation, lately purchased at _South-Carolina_. I
hope ere long to be delivered from my outward embarrassments. I long
to owe no man any thing but love. This is a debt, Reverend Sir, I shall
never be able to discharge to you, or your brother. JESUS will pay
you all. For his sake, I love and honour you very much, and rejoice
as much, in your success as in my own. I cannot agree with you in some
principles, but that need not hinder love; since I trust we hold the
foundation, even “JESUS, the same yesterday, to-day and for ever.”
Will you salute, in the kindest manner, all the followers of the Lamb
within your sphere of action? Grace, mercy and peace be multiplied
upon all their dear souls! I thank them for remembering a poor pilgrim,
who though faint is still pursuing, and determined, in the strength of
JESUS, to spend and be spent more and more for the good of poor sinners.
Perhaps before I see you, I may visit _Bermudas_ and _Cape-Breton_.
You will pray that the LORD may order my steps aright. What have you
done with the _Moravian Brethren_? their affairs are in confusion here.
I think their foundation is too narrow for their superstructure. I
believe in their plan there are many plants that our heavenly Father
hath not planted. The LORD bless what is right, and rectify what is
wrong in them, in us, and in all. Even so, LORD JESUS, Amen!――O for
heaven! where we shall mistake, judge, and grieve one another no more.
Lately I thought myself sailing several times into the blessed harbour;
but it seems I must put out to sea again. My Redeemer’s will be done!
Forgive, Reverend Sir, the prolixity of this. Love indites. I salute
you for my dear fellow pilgrim; who is gone forwards.――Continue to
pray for us, and assure yourself, that you are always remembered by,
Reverend and very dear Sir,

      Your most affectionate, though unworthy younger brother and
                  willing servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXXIII.


                    _To the Rev. Mr. C―――― W――――._

                                      _Philadelphia, Sept. 11, 1747._

_Very dear Sir_,

BOTH your letters and your prayers I trust have reached me. May mine
reach you also, and then it will not be long ere we shall indeed be one
fold under one Shepherd. However, if this should not be on earth, it
will certainly be effected in heaven. Thither I trust we are hastening
apace. Blessed be GOD that you are kept alive, and that your spiritual
children are increasing. May they increase more and more! JESUS can
maintain them all. He wills that his house should be full. Some have
wrote me things to your disadvantage. I do not believe them. Love
thinks no evil of a friend. Such are you to me. I love you most
dearly. I could write to you much more, but time and business will
not permit. You will see my letter to your dear brother. That you may
be guided into all truth, turn thousands and ten thousands more unto
righteousness, and shine as the stars in the future world, for ever and
ever, is the hearty prayer of, very dear Sir,

                    Yours most affectionately, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXXIV.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. M――――._

                                _Bohemia, (Maryland) Sept. 17, 1747._

_Honoured Sir_,

WILL you permit a young soldier of JESUS CHRIST to write to an
experienced veteran, before he goes hence, and is no more seen? Sorry
am I that my visit to _York_ was short, yet glad that our LORD gave me
to see you once more ready to sing your _Nunc dimittis_ with steadiness
and composure, if not with joy unspeakable, even a joy that is full
of glory.――Happy, thrice happy, Reverend Sir! You have gone through
that wilderness, which if hoary hairs should be my lot, awaits me your
younger son and servant. Well! this is my comfort: I have the same
Beloved to lean on, as you have had. The way, though narrow, is not
long; the gate, though strait, opens into life eternal. O that I might
pass through it when young; but, Father, not my will, but thine be
done! Honoured Sir, be pleased to pray for me. I remember you and
your dear flock, whom I love in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST. May he
who kissed away the soul of his beloved _Moses_, appoint a _Joshua_
to succeed you, when he bids you come up to the mount and die! I hope
my cordial respects will find acceptance with your dear yoke-fellow.
I remember what she said to me, and once more beg a continued interest
in your prayers. I beg leave to subscribe myself, honoured Sir,

     Your most affectionate tho’ unworthy younger son and willing
                 servant in him that liveth for ever,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCXXV.


                     _To the Rev. Mr. M―――― Jun._

                                           _Bohemia, Sept. 17, 1747._

I Have been writing to the father,――Love, love unfeigned constrains
me to write to the son also. I hope it will influence you to send me,
however unworthy, a line or two in return. Reverend and dear Sir, how
do you? Are you yet GOD’s mouth to the people? Surely if the prayers
of faith keep me alive, the prayers of faith must open your mouth,
and constrain you in preaching to shew forth your glorious Redeemer’s
praise. All things are possible with GOD.

              _Blest is faith, that trusts his power;_
              _Blest are saints, that wait his hour;_
              _Haste, great Conqueror, bring it near,_
              _Let the wish’d-for thing appear._

But you do not like that I should write about yourself? Will you then
permit me to tell you, that in spite of all my corruptions, JESUS still
continues to bless unworthy me. He gave me a prosperous journey to
_New-York_, and there, as well as at _Philadelphia_, he opened my mouth
to shew forth his praise. My outward circumstances are made easier, and
I trust, in a short time I shall owe no man any thing but love. I am
now posting southward, willing to follow the cloud wheresoever it shall
point in the spring. O pray, pray that JESUS may be my comforter and my
guide. Great are my trials, but greater my consolations. O free, rich,
and sovereign grace! Help me, dear Sir, to extol and praise it. You
will remember me to all. Your ¹_fidus achates_, and your dear faithful
nurse, I shall never forget. When you go to _Kittery_, pray make my
most dutiful respects acceptable to Sir _William_ and his consort.
Wishing you, what Colonel _Gardiner_ once wished me, “A thriving soul
in a healthful body,” I subscribe myself, Reverend and very dear Sir,

                        Yours in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

                            LETTER DCXXVI.


                         _To Mr. J―――― S――――._

                           _Bath-Town, North Carolina, Oct. 6, 1747._

_Very dear Sir_,

I Wrote you a few lines just as I was leaving _Bohemia_. They informed
you of the receipt of my bills, and by them I also desired you to pay
the remainder of what you have of mine into the hands of Mr. _D――――
V――――_ of _New-York_. Since that, I have posted forward here, and hope
to see some souls in this province all in love with JESUS, and made
partakers of the power of his Resurrection. I have preached three times,
and purpose, GOD willing, to preach many times more. The LORD seems to
have given me the affections of the people, and I am determined in his
strength to see what can be done amongst them. The box of books sent
hither from Mr. _K――――_ and _G――――_ never came to hand. Be pleased to
make some enquiry about it. I preached once in _Virginia_, and would
have preached oftner; but the small-pox was spreading, the assembly did
not sit, and I wanted to let _North-Carolina_ have as much time as I
could. I hope to write to you again from _Charles-Town_. There, I shall
be glad to hear that the all-wise head of the church hath directed you
to a suitable pastor in the room of Dr. _Coleman_. I sometimes think
all will go to heaven before me. I am weak and faint, I long to be
dissolved and to be with JESUS, but cannot die. My heavenly Father’s
will be done! I would have you still pray for me, as a dying man; but
O pray that I may not go off as a snuff. I would fain die blazing, not
with human glory, but the love of JESUS. I wish you, and yours, and all
dear friends, as much of this as your hearts can hold. I remember you
daily and hourly. I will thank you in heaven for what you have done for
me on earth, and till then shall subscribe myself, dear Sir,

                       Yours in the best bonds,
                                                              _G. W._

                           _Bath-Town, North-Carolina, Oct. 6, 1747_.

_Dear Madam_,

BE pleased to accept this, as a token that you are not forgotten by
me;――no, I loved your deceased husband, I honour and pray for his dear
and sorrowful relict. I would give you that advice, dear Madam, which
I believe he would do, was he to rise from his grave, “Make sure of
a CHRIST, and give the LORD no rest, till you can say, my maker is my
husband, the LORD of Hosts is his name.” What have you now to do, Madam,
but to make sure of a CHRIST? You are desolate, why should you not
put your trust in the LORD? Widows, godly ministers widows, are GOD’s
peculiar care. O that you may have reason to say, “It is good for me
that I have been afflicted.” Now is your time to learn GOD’s law. Come
to JESUS, Madam, close with him, and give him your whole heart. I need
not tell you, that he will make you happy. He has made me so, even me
the chief of sinners. As such be pleased to pray for, dear Madam,

              Your real, affectionate friend and servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCXXVIII.


                           _To Mrs. A――――._

                           _Bath-Town, North-Carolina, Oct. 6, 1747._

_Dear Madam_,

BE where I will, the LORD JESUS puts you upon my heart. I often think
you happy, because you are so circumstanced that you must necessarily
drink of the waters of life at the fountain head. It drinks sweetest
from thence. Communion with GOD’s children is sweet; but communion
with GOD himself is infinitely sweeter. The woman of _Samaria_ found
it so. When the disciples came and interrupted her fellowship with
their master, she left her water pot and went her way. Blessed be GOD,
that happy time is coming when we shall enjoy both him and his without
interruption. Till then, dear Madam, be content to have little or much
of the company of CHRIST’s people, as your heavenly father shall judge
most convenient. Heaven is before you, time is flying on eagles wings.
Eternity, an happy eternity awaits you when time shall be no more. O
that it would approach faster to me! But why so hasty, O my soul! In
heaven thou canst not deny thyself for JESUS CHRIST! Dear Madam, pray
for me, that my will may be swallowed up in the will of GOD. That it
may be so with you, is the hearty prayer of, dear Madam,

              Your most affectionate friend and servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXXIX.


                            _To Mr. P――――._

                           _Bath-Town, North-Carolina, Oct. 6, 1747._

_Dear Mr. P――――_,

OUR affectionate parting is not yet out of my remembrance. Since that,
I hope you have been diligent, and ere now have got an evidence that we
shall not be parted hereafter. O for assurance! It is indeed the anchor
of the soul. It keeps it steady in the midst of storms. Dear Sir,
press after it, as you value your present as well as eternal welfare.
Tell the LORD JESUS, you cannot do without it. I once thought dear Mr.
_P――――_ would be one of the first-rate christians in _New-England_.
What hath hindered you? Whatever it be, whether a right hand or a right
eye, may the LORD JESUS take it away! Will you say _Amen_ heartily?
You will excuse this freedom. I always write so to those I love. Pray
remember me to your mother, wife, and all friends. Tell them I am
here, hunting after sinners in _North-Carolina_ woods. It is pleasant
work, though my body is weak and crazy. After a short fermentation in
the grave, it will be fashioned like unto CHRIST’s glorious body. The
thought of this rejoices my soul, and makes me long to leap my seventy
years. O pray for me, that I may have patience to tarry the LORD’s
leisure. I commit you to his care. I charge you in his great name, not
to let me miss you in heaven, and with much love subscribe myself, dear
Mr. _P――――_,

        Your very affectionate friend, and willing servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCXXX.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                                      _Oct. 6, 1747._

_My dear Mr. S――――_,

LET who will be omitted when I am writing to _New-England_, I think, I
am under many obligations not to forget you. Blessed be GOD for making
you a christian merchant, and teaching you the holy art of trafficking
for the LORD. You trade upon a safe bottom. Your all is insured, and
you shall receive your own with good usury at the great day. Go on,
my dear man, spend and be spent for CHRIST’s people; it is a glorious
employ. I would not but be thus engaged for millions of worlds. It is
true, I am decaying daily; but resolved in the strength of JESUS to
die fighting. At present I am engaged in _North-Carolina_, and hope ere
long to send you good news from this ungospelized wilderness. In about
a month I expect to see _Charles-Town_. The LORD direct me where to go
in the Spring. Several ways present. I am willing to see more of the
north before I return to my native country. But alas! why write I thus?
How many important hours will intervene? O that every minute may be
employed for GOD, even a GOD in CHRIST. Indeed he is a good master.
He wounds, but he heals also. He brings down, but raises up again.
He humbles, but it is only in order to exalt his dear children. This
you and I shall find, as we have found already, times without number,
perfectly true, by happy experience. But I cannot enlarge. You will
deliver the enclosed. I hope my last to the dear Messrs. _M――――’s_ came
safe. I will write to more as business, opportunity, and health permit.
In the mean while, accept our joint most cordial love to all dear, very
dear friends. Accept the same to you and yours. I am, dear Sir,

               Yours eternally in the everlasting I AM,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXXXI.


                            _To Mr. R――――._

                           _Bath-Town, North-Carolina, Oct. 7, 1747._

_Very dear Sir_,

BY this time (such is your love to unworthy me,) I suppose you
are willing to know where I am, and what I am doing. Blessed be
GOD, I am still employed in my old delightful work, “calling poor
sinners to repentance.”――I trust a day of power will shortly come to
_North-Carolina_. I have preached three times already, and am now going
a small circuit round about. I expect to reach _Charles-Town_ in a
month’s time. But give me leave in my turn to enquire, how it is with
you and yours? Are your resolutions more and more invigorated, and hath
JESUS at length taken possession of your whole heart? I must not let
you alone, till you can fairly and truly say, “’Tis done, ’tis done.” O
what a revenue of glory might a person in your station bring to CHRIST,
and what a radiant crown of grace might you secure to your own soul,
was you but once in earnest to lay up treasure in heaven, where neither
moth nor rust doth corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal! Rise,
rise, dear Sir, awake and sleep no more. JESUS waits to give you light.
May he so fill you with his light and love, that you may rejoice in
his great salvation all the day long! Pray let me hear from you in the
Winter. I am more concerned for you than ever. Your late favours have
increased my obligations to be so. I shall be glad to hear that the
LORD hath given you a son. I remember dear Madam _R――――_, and hope to
drop her a few lines. May the glorious _Emmanuel_ make little Miss a
wise virgin. My love awaits Mrs. _H――――_, and your whole houshold. You
will remember me in the kindest manner to Mrs. _G――――_, _L――――_, &c.
and the whole circle of my female friends. Praying that grace, mercy
and peace may be multiplied upon all, subscribe myself, dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXXXII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. L――――._

                          _Bath-Town, North-Carolina, Oct. 11, 1747._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

IT has given me much concern, that I could not comply with your kind
invitation to _Plymouth_, but providence plainly pointed my course
another way. GOD only knows what a cross it was to me, to leave dear
_New-England_ so soon. I hope death will not be so bitter to me, as was
parting from my friends. Glad shall I be to be prayed thither again,
before I see my native land. But future things belong to GOD. I would
be just where he would have me, though it be in the uttermost parts of
the earth. At present I am hunting after poor lost sinners in these
ungospelized wilds. People are willing to hear, and blessed be the LORD
of all lords, I am willing to preach. My body is yet weak. A little
riding fatigues me; but he that has been, is, and I trust will be my
strength, my support, and my guide even unto death. Dear Sir, continue
to pray for me. I wish you much of the divine presence, and hope the
LORD will yet make you a spiritual father to thousands. Be pleased to
remember me in the kindest manner to dear Mr. _F――――_, and the whole
circle of those reverend brethren, who dare confess CHRIST’s work, and
CHRIST’s truths. I salute your whole large fire side, and am, reverend
and dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCXXXIII.


                            _To Mr. P――――._

                                          _Bath-Town, Oct. 11, 1747._

_Very dear Mr. P――――_,

I Am ashamed to think that your short though exceeding sweet and kind
letter, lies as yet unanswered. Want of health and of time, (assure
yourself) not want of love, has been the cause of it. The searcher
of hearts alone knows, what a cordial reverential respect I bear your
honoured father and mother, yourself, and dear sister. I must not write
much on this head, lest my eyes should gush out with water. Sorry am
I, very sorry, dear Sir, that the church is not to have the benefit of
your labours. But what shall we say? GOD is a sovereign GOD. He must
do what he will with his own. This comforts me, that I trust you have
learned to be in the world, and yet not of it. Well then, since it
must be so, go, dear Sir, and trade for GOD. Let merchants see by your
example, that JESUS CHRIST can make many saints in a store. O may you
daily taste, and feel the efficacy of his all-atoning, heart-cleansing,
world-conquering, precious blood! I trust this is dearer and weightier
to me than ever. I am now proclaiming it in these uncultivated
ungospelized desarts. People hear with great attention, and I trust ere
long news will be heard in heaven, that some _North-Carolina_ sinners
are born of GOD. I stayed but a small time in _Virginia_ and _Maryland_,
that I might give this province the more time. I hope to be in
_Charles-Town_ in about a month, and soon after my arrival, expect
to determine what course to take in the spring. Several ways present
themselves. May JESUS direct me which to take! Weak as I am, I am
willing to spend and be spent for that ever-lovely, ever-loving JESUS,
who has done so much for, and borne so long with me. I am afraid some
of you have prayed me back into the world again. Well, it cannot be
long ere I get my dismission. O for a triumphant exit. LORD JESUS keep
me from going off like a snuff! But it is time to bid you good night.
I have been on a forty mile excursion, and this tabernacle of mine is
weak. You will remember me to all your dear family, and all friends.
I will name none, that if possible I may offend none. However, this I
must say, _New-England_ friends are dearer to me than ever, and glad
shall I be, if another sight of them before I die, be permitted to,
very dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

                                     _Everards-Ferry, Oct. 16, 1747._

_Dear Mr. D――――_,

THE love I owe you for JESUS CHRIST’s sake, induces me to send you a
few lines. I hope they will find you yet more and more convinced of
self-righteousness, and the absolute necessity of being cloathed with
the all-sufficient, compleat and everlasting righteousness of JESUS
CHRIST. This, and this only is the ground of our acceptance with a holy,
just, and sin-avenging GOD. Here the sinner may find a sure asylum, an
everlasting, never-failing refuge. Happy they! who begin to see, feel,
and taste this, in a realizing spiritual manner. It is the budding
of grace, the beginning of the kingdom of GOD in the soul. May I
hope that dear Mr. _D――――_ is one of these happy men. I trust so. You
seemed beginning to awake out of nature’s dream when I left you. O that
nothing may prevail on you to lie down to sleep again! It is dangerous
to trifle with the spirit of GOD. When he puts into our hearts good
desires, he expects that we shall be workers together with him. Strive
therefore, on, as the word imports, _agonize_ with GOD, yourself,
and the world, in order that you may enter into the strait gate of a
thorough sound conversion. You know who has told you “that the kingdom
of GOD suffereth violence, and the violent only take it by force.” And
surely heaven is worth striving for; especially since we are sure of
a conquest; and JESUS CHRIST, the captain of our salvation, stands
ready to assist, support, and strengthen at every rencounter. Learn
therefore to endure hardness, like a good soldier of JESUS CHRIST:
adopt _Joshua_’s resolution, stand the laugh, quit yourself like a man,
put your hand to the plough, and do not look back; fight the good fight
of faith, lay hold on eternal life. I could write more, but I want
time and paper. Blessed be GOD, I am as well as a pilgrim in my way
can expect to be. I am happy in CHRIST, and that is all in all. I wish
you and yours this happiness. I pray you may be partakers of it. This
is the best return I can make for all kindnesses shewn to, dear Sir,

            Your affectionate, obliged friend and servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXXXV.


                           _To Mrs. D――――._

                                     _Everards-Ferry, Oct. 16, 1747._

_Dear Mrs. D――――_,

AS it is uncertain whether I shall ever see you again in this vale of
tears, I cannot help expressing my gratitude for kindnesses received,
by sending you a few lines.――And what shall I say? Why, that I trust
you at length see, that what the world calls an innocent, harmless,
decent, sober life, will not be sufficient to carry us to heaven. Such
a life I suppose you have led, and assure yourself, you will find it
an hard work to give up such a life in point of dependence, and to come
as a poor, ill and hell deserving wretch, to be washed in the blood and
cloathed with the righteousness of JESUS CHRIST. Nature will struggle,
and a reasoning infidelity will stand at the door of your heart, lest
JESUS CHRIST’s spirit should enter in and make you happy. But all
things are possible with GOD. Apply to him therefore, dear Madam,
and beg him to let you see that your heart is desperately wicked, and
deceitful above all things. Strengthen your husband’s hands; be as a
goad in his side, if you see him inclined (though I trust you will not)
to forget what he hath lately felt and been convinced of. And O that
you may be an happy instrument of converting your two daughters! It
is sweet when all of one house are agreed to worship the LORD JESUS in
spirit and in truth. That you and yours may be all such worshippers,
is the earnest prayer of, dear Madam,

       Your real friend, and willing servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXXXVI.


                         _To Mr. T―――― A――――._

                              _Wilmington, Cape-Fear, Oct. 18, 1747._

_My very dear brother A――――_,

I Have lately written to you and many other dear _English_ friends.
I am now in my way to _Georgia_, and hope to see my native country
some time next year. My sphere of action still increases, and though I
hoped this last Summer to have taken my flight to the blessed JESUS,
yet it seems I am to live longer. O that it may be for the Redeemer’s
glory, and the good of many precious and immortal souls! I know you
will say _Amen_! I could write much, but am fatigued, having preached
several times, and rode on horse-back through the woods an hundred
and sixty miles. JESUS makes the barren wilderness to smile. I want
to know how affairs go on among you. I expect letters from some of
you at _Charles-Town_, and I hope to see you, I repeat it again, some
time next year. But future things belong to GOD. My schemes are so
frequently disconcerted, that I would willingly put a blank into his
hands, to be filled up just as he pleases. But this stubborn will
would fain avoid swallowing some wholesome bitter-sweets, which the
all-gracious physician reaches out unto me. Nevertheless, through
grace, the prevailing language of my heart is, “Not my will, but
thine be done.” The being so long absent from my friends, sometimes
a little affects me; but I have been used to so many partings, and
heart-breakings from various quarters, that I wonder any thing affects,
so as to surprize me. But the mystery of the cross is unsearchable.
We shall never fully learn it till we die. We must be beginners in
this school every day, hour, and moment. But where am I going? I write
as though I was conversing with you. Perhaps such a time may come. In
heaven I am sure such a time will have existence. The language of my
heart is, LORD JESUS, let thy kingdom come! You will remember me to all.
I must now say no more. Whilst I am writing, affection works and almost
makes me to say, O that I had wings like a dove, for then would I fly
away, and see my _English_ and _Scotch_ friends! I salute all most
heartily, as does my dear fellow pilgrim.――That grace, mercy and peace
may be multiplied upon all your dear souls, is the hearty prayer of, my
dear Man,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

                     _Charles-Town, (South-Carolina,) Oct. 25, 1747._

_Very dear Mr. B――――_,

I Hear a ship sails to-morrow for _Philadelphia_. I cannot help letting
you know, that we arrived here last night in health and safety. The
barren wilderness was made to smile all the way. I trust good was
done in _North-Carolina_. The poor people were very willing to hear.
I expected, on my arrival at this place, to have received letters and
sundry things from you, or dear Mr. _B――――_. If they are taken, may the
LORD JESUS give me a thankful heart! I would write you a long letter,
and I would also write to many friends, but you know travellers are
weary, and I must away to-morrow to _Georgia_. All is well there,
and at my new plantation. You will send the inclosed.――Mr. _Dutton_ I
believe is lost in his return to _England_. The ship foundered. I have
preached this morning, and am to preach again. I snatch a few moments
between sermons to write this. Our tender joint love to you all.

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                                            _Bermudas, May 27, 1748._

_My dear Mr. F――――_,

INCLOSED you have a letter which you may print in your weekly paper. It
brings good news from this little pleasant spot. If you could print it
on half a sheet of paper, to distribute among the _Bermudas_ captains,
it might perhaps be serviceable. The inhabitants here have received me
so well, that I think publishing their kindness is a debt justly due
to them. I am now waiting for a fair wind, and then we shall sail for
_England_. The Governor’s lady goes with me. His Excellency is very
civil to me, and I believe many souls have been benefited by this visit
to _Bermudas_. I desire to give the LORD JESUS all the glory. You will
remember me to Mrs. _F――――_, and all my dear _Philadelphia_ friends. I
do not forget them, and hope they will always remember, dear Sir,

         Their and your most affectionate, obliged friend and
                               servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXXXIX.


                           _To Mrs. F――――._

                                  _On board the Betsy, June 2, 1748._

TILL last night, I did not know that the last letter I wrote to
you never came to hand. Mr. _B――――_ tells me, that as he did not go
according to his design he destroyed it. Accept therefore, dear Madam,
a few more parting lines. They bring you good news indeed. The LORD
JESUS has blessed my being at _Bermudas_ very much. A good work I trust
is begun in many hearts. I am now on board, and the wind is fair. We
expect to sail this day. According to my present view, I intend to
return to beloved _America_ next year; which is one of the reasons, why
I leave my dear yoke-fellow behind. O that I knew how it was with her!
But I see that GOD will make those he loves, to live by faith and not
by sense. Glorious privileges, though difficult to flesh and blood! As
you are so dear a friend, I know you will do your utmost to comfort her.
I have so ordered matters, that she need not be under any concern about
providing for the families. GOD has caused the people in _Bermudas_ to
devise liberal things. Yet a little while, and I trust I shall, on the
Orphan-house account, owe no man any thing but love. But I find I must
fight every inch of my ground. Well! JESUS is on my side. I can do all
things through him strengthening me. An entrance is now made into the
_Islands_. The LORD, that has begun, can and will carry on his own work.
You will all help me with your prayers. I must be content with dealing
in general salutations, having not time to write more particulars. Pray
remember me in the kindest manner to all your relations and all our
dear friends. That grace, mercy, and peace may be multiplied upon all,
is the earnest prayer of, dear Mrs. _T――――_,

        Your most affectionate friend, brother, and servant, in
                             CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCXL.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. S――――._

                                 _On board the Betsy, June 24, 1748._

_Rev. and very dear Sir_,

THOUGH we are about two hundred leagues from land, yet lest hurry of
business should prevent me when we get a shore, I think proper to
write you a few lines whilst I am on board.――Long before this reaches
you, I suppose you will have heard of what the LORD of all Lords was
pleased to do for me and his people at, and also when we sailed from,
_Bermudas_. We sailed from thence just twenty-one days this morning,
and have lived, as to the conveniencies of eating and drinking, like
people that came from the continent, rather than one of the islands;
so bountiful were our friends, whom we left behind us. Hitherto we have
met with no storms or contrary winds, only it begins to head us now.
But GOD, in his own time, I trust will carry us to our desired port.
The first day we came out we were chased, and yesterday a large French
vessel shot thrice at and bore down upon us. We gave up all for gone.
I was dressing myself in order to receive our expected visitors. In
the mean while, our Captain cries, “the danger is over.” The Frenchman
turned about and left us. He was quite near, and we almost defenceless.
Now we are so near the channel, we expect such alarms daily. If any
thing happens extraordinary, I shall be particular. As for other
things, I cannot say much. The Captain is exceeding civil, and I have
my passage free; but all I have been able to do in the great ♦cabin in
respect to religious duties, is to read the church prayers once every
evening, and twice on the LORD’s day. I have not preached yet; this may
spare my lungs, but it grieves my heart. I long to be ashore, if it was
for no other reason. Besides, I can do but little in respect to my
writing. You may guess how it is, when we have four gentlewomen in the
cabin. However, they have been, and are very civil, and I believe my
being on board has been somewhat serviceable. My health I think is
improved, and I have finished my abridgment of Mr. _Law_’s serious
call, which I have endeavoured to gospelize. Yesterday I likewise made
an end of revising all my journals. Blessed be GOD, for letting me
have leisure to do it. I purpose to have a new edition before I see
_America_. Alas! alas! In how many things have I judged and acted
wrong.――I have been too rash and hasty in giving characters, both of
places and persons. Being fond of scripture language, I have often used
a style too apostolical, and at the same time I have been too bitter in
my zeal. Wild-fire has been mixed with it, and I find that I frequently
wrote and spoke in my own spirit, when I thought I was writing and
speaking by the assistance of the spirit of GOD. I have likewise too
much made inward impressions my rule of acting, and too soon and too
explicitly published what had been better kept in longer, or told after
my death. By these things I have given some wrong touches to GOD’s
ark, and hurt the blessed cause I would defend, and also stirred up
needless opposition. This has humbled me much since I have been on
board, and made me think of a saying of Mr. _Henry_’s, “_Joseph_ had
more _honesty_ than he had _policy_, or he never would have told his
dreams.” At the same time, I cannot but bless, and praise, and magnify
that good and gracious GOD, who filled me with so much of his holy
fire, and carried me, a poor weak youth, through such a torrent both
of popularity and contempt, and set so many seals to my unworthy
ministrations. I bless him for ripening my judgment a little more, for
giving me to see and confess, and I hope in some degree to correct and
amend, some of my mistakes. I thank GOD for giving me grace to embark
in such a blessed cause, and pray him to give me strength to hold
on and increase in zeal and love to the end. Thus, dear Sir, have I
unburdened my heart to you. I look upon you to be my _fidus achates_,
and therefore deal thus freely. If I have time and freedom before we
land, I think to write a short account of what has happened for these
seven years last past; and when I get on shore, GOD willing, I purpose
to revise and correct the first part of my life. I know you will pray
that I may be directed and owned in every thing. I think often of, and
pray for you, and as I intend writing to you again when I send this, I
shall content myself at present with subscribing myself, Reverend and
very dear Sir,

      Your most affectionate obliged though unworthy brother and
                               servant,
                                                              _G. W._

_Very dear and Honoured Mother_,

ARE you yet in the land of the living, or rather among the dead? shall
I have the pleasure of receiving one more letter from you, and asking
your blessing once more? Next post, I hope that the two former of
these will be answered in the affirmative, and in a week or two I trust
GOD will grant me the last. About a month ago I left the island of
_Bermudas_, where my poor labours have been greatly blessed, and your
unworthy son has been honoured with many honours. I am now come once
more to see my friends in my native country, and settle some affairs,
and then return to _America_ again. My dear yoke-fellow I have left
behind, to take care of two families. I have been several times
just upon the brink of eternity since I saw you, but am now a little
recruited. O that my health and strength may be wholly employed for
that JESUS who has done such great things for me! His blood and cross,
my ever honoured mother, I trust are exceeding precious to your soul.
O that I may see you laden with holiness, and bringing forth much
fruit in your old age! I could say more, but have several other letters
to write. As I know not how your outward affairs are situated, or
where you live for a certainty, I can only send cordial and general
salutations to all friends and relations. I hope you will be pleased
to let me know whether you stand in need of any thing, and not cease
to pray for, honoured mother,

                Your ever dutiful though unworthy son,
                                                              _G. W._

                                                _Deal, July 5, 1748._

AND how does my dear old friend Mr. _H――――_? Surely he will send me
a line now! For through the goodness of an infinitely gracious and
condescending Saviour, I am once more arrived at my native country. My
last excursion was to _Bermudas_. We left those islands a month ago,
and GOD was pleased to set his seal to my unworthy ministry in a very
glorious manner. I know you will be thankful in my behalf, and let me
know next post how the brethren are in and about _Gloucestershire_. I
rejoice to find that you still go on steadily and are not ashamed of
the gospel of CHRIST. Why should you? Have you not found it by happy
experience to be the power of GOD unto salvation? Go on then, my dear
Sir, and prove the strength of JESUS to be yours. I long to see you,
that we may talk of redeeming love, and feel our hearts warm with an
holy fire from GOD’s altar. Are the dear old men, the Reverend Messrs.
_S――――_ and _P――――_, yet alive? Pray send them my most dutiful and
affectionate respects, and let them know, that an entrance I trust is
now made into one of the islands for the glorious gospel of the Son
of GOD. O that I was able to fly from pole to pole upon this blessed
errand. But alas! my wings are clipped. My bodily health is much
impaired, and I hoped ere now to have taken my last flight to heaven.
But it seems that happy hour is not yet come. Well, welcome life,
welcome death, so that JESUS, my dear JESUS, may be glorified in both!
Pray that we may shortly meet in the fulness of the blessing of the
gospel of peace. I subscribe myself, my very dear _Gaius_,

                 Yours most affectionately in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._

                                                _Deal, July 5, 1748._

WILL you not be glad to hear that the GOD of the seas and the GOD of
the dry land hath brought me to my native country once more? I came
last from the _Bermudas_, where the friend of sinners has been pleased
to own my poor labours abundantly. I hope, I come in the spirit of love,
desiring to study and pursue those things which make for peace. This is
the language of my heart,

                _O let us find the ancient way,_
                  _Our wond’ring foes to move;_
                _And force the heathen world to say,_
                  _See how these Christians love._

I purpose, GOD willing, to be in _London_ in a few days. In the mean
while, I salute you and all the followers of the blessed Lamb of GOD
most heartily.――Be pleased to pray for, and give thanks in behalf of,
Reverend and dear brother,

                 Yours most affectionately in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

I Have but just time to inform you, that after a pleasant passage of
a month, a good and gracious GOD brought me hither in safety, where I
have been received by thousands with a joy that almost overcame both
them and me. I have preached once, and am this evening to preach again.
One large church is open. I cannot now descend to particulars.――I
can only send you a thousand thanks for all favours, beg my kindest
salutations may be presumed to all friends, and entreat the continuance
of your most fervent prayers in behalf of, my dear host and hostess,

                            Yours as usual,

_My very dear Friend_,

THOUGH I suppose you will see my dear wife’s letter, yet I must
send you a few lines. They bring you news of my safe arrival, and
wonderfully kind acceptance in my native country. The blessings
bestowed on me, have already, through the thanksgivings of thousands,
redounded to the glory of GOD. Words cannot express the joy that has
possessed the hearts of the people. I hear that the minds even of
enemies are much softened. I came at a critical juncture. I hear Mr.
―――― has stood up for me at _C――――_, and that one who preached before
the trustees hath spoke honourably of _Bethesda_. If GOD is pleased
to send us a general peace, I hope _Georgia_ will lift up its drooping
head. You may depend on hearing from me as often as possible. You will
remember me to all friends. I can only beg you to give thanks, and pray
for, my very dear Sir,

                            Yours as usual,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXLVI.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. H――――._

                                              _London, July 8, 1748._

_Rev. and dear Brother_,

GLAD am I, yea very glad to hear that you are yet alive and have
grace given you to adhere to JESUS CHRIST and his eternal truths.
I am very much pleased to find that you appear in print, and that
such encouragement is given you to print again. I hope the glorious
_Emmanuel_ smiles upon your ministerial labours, and gives you many
living witnesses, that the truths which you preach are according to
Godliness. Go on, my dear old friend, and prove the strength of JESUS
to be thine. Through his infinite and unmerited goodness I am once
more safe in my native country. _Bermudas_ was the last place where
I have been preaching. I left many souls under concern. Many precious
souls (O free grace!) have received me here in great love, and I have
been enabled twice to preach, to a multitude of poor sinners, the
unsearchable riches of JESUS CHRIST. My bodily health is much impared;
but through divine assistance, I will go on working for JESUS of
_Nazareth_, ’till I can work no more. I could say much of his love, but
have a deal of business before me. Accept this as a token of unfeigned
love and respect from, my very dear Sir,

       Your affectionate though unworthy brother and servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXLVII.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                                              _London, July 8, 1748._

_Dear Mr. C――――_,

I Am come over with a sincere desire to pursue the things which
make for peace. Consequently I must hear and see for myself, before
I determine upon any thing. I have heard nothing of Mrs. _D――――_’s
writing concerning you. All I can say is, that by what you have
published and I have perused, you have unhappily fallen into some
principles, which are contrary to the revealed will of GOD.――But I
speak not this to begin a dispute. I shall be glad to see and converse
with you. As for your preaching in _Moor-fields_, they are no doubt
as free for you as another. I intend preaching there, GOD willing, on
_Sunday_ evening. That you may have a clear head and a clean heart, is
the hearty prayer of, dear Sir,

                 Your affectionate friend and servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCXLVIII.


                            _To Mr. K――――._

                                             _London, July 12, 1748._

_My dear Brother_,

AT my first arrival, you judged right that I am pretty much taken up;
however, I must snatch a few minutes to answer your kind, very kind
letter. Blessed be GOD, that the mercies bestowed on hell-deserving me,
have, through the thanksgivings of many, redounded to the glory of the
blessed JESUS. O that the same prayers that have drawn me hither, may
draw down showers of blessings upon GOD’s church. Now I am come, do
you and my other friends continue to pray and hold up your hands, and
in the strength of JESUS CHRIST I will go on fighting. The fields seem
to be as white as ever. I trust the shout of a king is among us. O for
humility, love and zeal! O for that mind, which was in CHRIST JESUS!
I trust that the members of your society are copying after our great
Exemplar. As soon as possible I purpose to come down and see you. I
thank you for what you have done in respect to the Orphan-house. I
could wish the cash was remitted to _London_ immediately, because I
want to pay it away. Surely the time will come, when I shall owe no
man any thing but love. Then, and ’till the day of my death, _Poor,
yet making many rich_, shall be my motto. You will remember me in the
kindest manner to all the followers of the Lamb; and that you may be
filled with all his fulness, is the prayer of

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXLIX.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                                             _London, July 12, 1748._

_My very dear Friend and Brother_,

THOUGH I am pretty much engaged, yet I cannot let your kind letter lie
by me two posts unanswered. Blessed be GOD that you yet retain your
simple heart, and are determined to know nothing but JESUS CHRIST and
him crucified. With this mind, may you climb up higher and higher in
the church of _England_, in order that you may move in a superiour
orb, and your light shine with greater and more diffusive ardor round
the church of GOD! O my dear Mr. _C――――_, what has the Redeemer done
for us! What is he still doing! It would gladden your heart to see
what a turn affairs take in _London_. I have preached twice in _St.
Bartholomew_’s church, and helped to administer the sacrament once. I
believe on _Sunday_ we had a thousand communicants. _Moor-fields_ are
as white as ever unto harvest, and multitudes flock to hear the word.
The old spirit of love and power seems to be revived amongst us. What
am I, what am I, that JESUS CHRIST should still delight to honour me? O
for a single eye and a simple heart unto the end! By what I can judge,
satan will allure some with his golden bait. “In all times of our
wealth, good LORD deliver us.” Blessed be GOD, I am not much in danger
of having too much of this world’s goods at present. My outward affairs
are yet behind hand. I long to owe no man any thing but love. As for
your cautions, they shall be observed punctually. Never mind me, let my
name die every where, let even my friends forget me, if by that means
the cause of the blessed JESUS may be promoted. In about a fortnight
I hope to see you at my brother’s. I hear he is better. O that he may
come out for CHRIST! I think I have now answered your request, and
sent you a long letter. I hope to hear from you again before I see you.
My hearty respects await Mr. _G――――_. I trust he determines to know
nothing but JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified. Commending you to his
mercy, and myself to the continuance of your prayers, I subscribe
myself, very dear Sir,

                 Yours eternally in the blessed JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER DCL.


           _To the Honourable ―――― R――――, Esq.; of Bermuda._

                                             _London, July 12, 1748._

_Honoured Sir_,

GRATITUDE constrains me to embrace the first opportunity of informing
you of our safe arrival at our wished-for port. We struck ground, I
think, the 27th day after we set sail, and landed at _Deal_ the 30th.
We were chased the first afternoon, and prepared for going to prison
twice or thrice. But our fears were groundless; there was a cessation
of arms with _France_, though we knew it not, and some ships that we
thought were pursuing us proved to be _English_ men of war. We had
plenty of provisions, and met with no storms or bad weather worth the
speaking of. Other particulars, I suppose, Captain _E――――_, who was
very civil, will inform you. The evening after we landed at _Deal_,
I was at Mr. _D――――_ and _E――――_’s, before I came to my own lodgings.
They were very glad to hear from _Bermudas_. Since then, words cannot
well express how joyful my friends were to see me once more in the
land of the living. I find the news-papers had buried me ever since
_April_ last; but it seems I am not to die, but live: O that it may
be to declare the works of the LORD! My obligations to do so, are much
increased by the mercies conferred on me at _Bermudas_, and during
my voyage. Surely the stones would cry out against me, did I not set
forth the riches of redeeming love. Blessed be GOD, I have had several
opportunities of doing so, since my arrival. Last Lord’s-day I believe
we had a thousand communicants. In a few weeks, GOD willing, I purpose
to see _Scotland_, and then shall do myself the pleasure of writing to,
or waiting on your brother. In the mean time, I shall, as opportunity
offers write to some more of my _Bermudas_ friends, whom I desire never
to forget at the throne of grace. You and yours, honoured Sir, will be
pleased to accept my most cordial salutations. That you and your house
may serve the LORD here, and live with him eternally in the kingdom of
heaven hereafter, is the hearty prayer of, honoured Sir,

                   Your most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCLI.


                            _To Mr. H――――._

                                             _London, July 16, 1748._

_My very dear Mr. H――――_,

I Thank you for your speedy and kind answer to my last poor letter, and
heartily pray GOD, if it be agreeable to his will, yet to prolong your
life, and make your pen the pen of a ready writer. I shall take it as a
great favour, if you will order me a set of your works. I shall peruse
them with the greatest pleasure, and send a set of them also abroad.
Blessed be GOD, for causing you to write so to suit the taste of the
polite world! O that they may be won over to admire Him, who is indeed
altogether lovely! But what shall I say to your kind intended present?
It is like my dear old friend. Mr. ―――― was so kind as to come and see
me yesterday. I shewed him your letter. He expects to see me at his
house. GOD willing, if possible I will pay him a visit. O that he may
recover his first love! For ever adored be free grace: many souls seem
to be quickened. Multitudes flock to hear. My health somewhat improves,
and our LORD makes it exceeding pleasant to me to preach to poor
sinners his unsearchable riches. O when shall we get within the veil!
Thanks be to GOD, it cannot be long. We are both sickly. LORD give us
patience to wait till our blessed change come! To the Redeemer’s tender
mercy do I most earnestly commit you; and entreat, while life and
breath lasts, you will not cease praying for one, who, though less than
the least of all, yet for JESUS CHRIST’s sake subscribes himself, my
very dear friend,

                              Ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCLII.


                            _To Mr. K――――._

                                             _London, July 19, 1748._

_Very dear Sir_,

I Thank you for your kind answer to my last, as well as for all other
favours. Before I heard from you, I had been informed from several
quarters that Satan hath been sifting all our poor societies. This
is no more than I expected. But let us take courage, dear Sir; JESUS
CHRIST prays for us. His truths are great and shall prevail. At
_London_, affairs seem to be taking a good turn. The LORD JESUS comes
among us as in the days of old. I trust by and by we shall see good
days at _Exon_ again. When I shall go there is uncertain. Next week,
GOD willing, I must be at _Bristol_, and after that I must go to the
_Welch_ association. Glad shall I be to hear whatever you have to
offer. May the LORD JESUS give us a right judgment in all things! When
the time of my seeing _Exon_ is fixed, I will endeavour to send you
previous notice. In the meanwhile, let you and yours accept most hearty
love and cordial salutations from one, who, though less than the least
of all saints, begs leave to subscribe himself, very dear Mr. _K――――_,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. C――――._

                                             _London, July 20, 1748._

_My very dear Friend and Brother_,

NEITHER length of time, nor change of place, I trust, will ever
estrange us from each other.――Though through the goodness of GOD I
am now in _England_, yet I cannot help daily thinking upon you and my
other dear friends in _America_. I have been prayed over hither: do
you strive to pray me over again to _South-Carolina_. Much business
now lies upon my hands. It is too much for one man, to be received as
I have been by thousands. The thoughts of it lay me low, but I cannot
get low enough. I would willingly sink into nothing before the blessed
JESUS, my All in All. Next week I hope to see _Bristol_, where I shall
not fail to enquire about your minister, and send you word accordingly.
I hope you do not forget _Bethesda_ or _Providence_. O my dear
yoke-fellow, how is she carried through the Summer’s sultry heat?
May the LORD be her helper! You will not fail to give my most cordial
respects to Mrs. _B――――_, Dr. _B――――_, his wife, and all friends. Fail
not, O fail not to pray heartily for,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCLIV.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. D――――._

                                             _London, July 23, 1748._

_My very Dear Mr. D――――,_

GLAD was I, yea very glad to receive one more letter from such a
valuable and dearly beloved friend and brother. I have often enquired
after you since my arrival, and only multiplicity of business prevented
your hearing from me. Glory be to the blessed JESUS, for supporting and
carrying you through so many difficulties that necessarily attend the
pastoral office. I find more and more, my dear Sir, that experience is
only to be learned in the school of tribulation; and as we undergo the
sufferings mentioned in the scriptures, so far and no farther do we
understand the scriptures themselves. O that patience may have its
perfect work, and we may be enabled to the end of our days to sanctify
the LORD GOD in our hearts! As for poor _Scotland_, what shall I say?
Our LORD’s words must be fulfilled, “The first shall be last, and the
last first.” Awakening times are always like the Spring. Many blossoms
appear, and perhaps but little solid fruit is produced after all. O
that the Lord of the harvest, if I am to see _Scotland_ again, may send
me to call some backsliders to return. Glory be to GOD, affairs are
taking a happy turn here. Old love, and old power, seem to be reviving
among us. I preach to multitudes daily. Many are already brought
under new awakenings. On _Monday_ next I set out, GOD willing, for
_Gloucester_, and intend returning in about three weeks.――How glad
shall I then be to see Mr. _D――――_. My dear yoke-fellow would rejoice
to do so too; but I left her abroad in the tent.――Perhaps she may come
over soon. Pray remember her, and, my dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCLV.


                            _To Dr. R――――._

                                             _London, July 22, 1748._

_Honoured Sir_,

LOVE and gratitude constrain me to send you a few lines. They come
to inform you, that a sense of the almost innumerable favours you
was pleased to confer on me, when under your tuition, is yet deeply
engraven upon the tables of my heart. That GOD, whom I endeavour to
serve in the gospel of his dear Son, will richly reward you in that day.
By his assistance, I still continue to preach the everlasting gospel
in various places; and, I trust, not without some abiding good effect.
Indeed, last year I was in hopes I should have been translated to those
blissful regions, where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the
weary be at rest. But it seems, I am not yet to die, but live. O that
it may be to declare the works of the LORD! I think his glory is the
main principle of my acting. I want to bring souls, not to a party,
much less to lead them from the established church, but to a sense of
their undone condition by nature, and to true faith in JESUS CHRIST,
which will be evidenced by a holy life, and an universal, chearful
obedience to all the commands of GOD. In this, honoured Sir, however
you may judge of the means and method of my proceeding, I am persuaded
you wish me success. Your’s, both in respect to this life and another,
I have much at heart. That the great shepherd and bishop of souls may
assist you in the oversight of all under your care, and in the future
state receive you with an _Euge bone_, in the presence of applauding
angels, and spirits of just men made perfect, is the earnest prayer of,
honoured Sir,

       Your most unworthy, though dutiful pupil, and very humble
                               servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCLVI.


                         _To Governor Thomas._

                                             _London, July 22, 1748._

_Honoured Sir_,

THOUGH I am uncertain about your being in town, yet I cannot leave it,
without leaving a few lines of acknowledgment, for those many favours
you and your worthy lady were pleased to confer upon me and mine
abroad. Glad were we, yea exceeding glad to hear of your safe arrival
in _England_, and gracious reception at court. May you so live in this
world, as to be received with expressions of joy and approbation by
the King of kings in the world to come! I hope, honour’d Sir, that the
change of climate has been conducive to your health, and the health
also of dear little Miss, and her honoured Mamma. I beg my most dutiful
respects may find acceptance, honoured Sir, both with them and you. At
my return to _London_, which I suppose will be in about three weeks, I
purpose doing myself the honour of waiting upon you in person. In the
mean while, I beg leave, with the warmest affection, to subscribe
myself, honoured Sir,

              Your most obliged, obedient humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLVII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. S――――._

                                             _London, July 24, 1748._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

SINCE my arrival in _England_, (now three weeks) I have sent several
packets to _America_. This brings you the welcome tidings of the LORD’s
continuing to bless my poor administrations, and causing his word to
run and be glorified. Particulars I cannot descend to now. My hands
are quite full of business. I am assisted also in temporals, and hope,
ere I see _America_ again, to be delivered from my outward Orphan-house
embarrassments. I have almost fixed on persons to come over to
_Bethesda_. With them I intend sending you some things, which I believe
you will be glad to see. _Antinomianism_ has made havock here, but I
trust the worst is over. Our scattered troops begin to unite again;
and indeed the shout of a king is amongst us. I trust that the glorious
_Emmanuel_ waves his banner also over you, and causes you to rejoice in
his great salvation. That you, and all my dear friends and benefactors
may fit under his shadow with unspeakable delight, is the hearty prayer
of, reverend and very dear Sir,

     Your most affectionate, obliged friend, brother, and servant
                          in our common Lord,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLVIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. S――――._

                                         _Waterford, August 3, 1748._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

I Have written to you more than once since my arrival; notwithstanding
that, I must write to you again. The bearer is a man of good report,
a _Dissenter_, and brings I believe a testimonial with him. He has met
with disappointments in the world, and goes out to be overseer to some
gentleman’s plantation.――I believe he would be glad to be introduced
to some of our religious friends. I write this from _Wales_, where I am
come to attend on a quarterly association. Yesterday I left _Bristol_,
where great multitudes came to hear, and the arm of the LORD was
revealed. Next week, GOD willing, I purpose to return to _London_,
and after a short stay there, to go into the _West_ and other parts of
_England_. I believe that _Ireland_ and _Scotland_ must be left till
next Spring. I am as well in health as I have been for a long while;
and GOD is pleased to give me the affections of his people, in a manner
I dared not expect. But is there any thing too hard for the LORD? You
will continue to pray for me. I expect a loving, chiding letter from
you. I have several things to send you, and at present can only beg you
and all friends to accept of my hearty love and thanks, and subscribe
myself, very dear Sir,

          Your most affectionate, obliged friend, and servant
                              in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCLIX.


                          _To Mr. Wm. G――――._

                                         _Waterford, August 3, 1748._

_My dear little Man_,

I Do not forget the promise I made you when in town. As a proof of it,
I snatch a few moments to send you a line. How will it find you? May I
answer for you? Upon the stretch for GOD, and giving diligence to make
your calling and election sure. O that there may be always in you such
a mind! You know how many once did run well; but the devil and the
world working upon their wicked hearts, have hindered them. Alas! how
is their gold become dim, and their fine gold changed! Let him that
thinketh he stands take heed lest he fall. Be jealous of yourself, and
hang continually on the LORD JESUS. You are now growing up, and are
about to launch into a wicked world. You know how strangely satan will
tempt you to love it. Nothing can keep you, but the mighty power of GOD.
Ask, and you shall have it exerted in your behalf. I could enlarge, but
have not time. Perhaps next week I may be in _London_. The LORD JESUS
has blessed my being in the country. The fields are white, ready unto
harvest. My love to your sister. May she be a _Ruth_. For the present I
must bid you farewel, after having subscribed myself,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCLX.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. M――――._

                                      _Mitchel-Dean, August 6, 1748._

THOUGH I am now upon the road in my way to _Gloucester_, yet I cannot
help dropping you a few lines. Excess of business, not want of respect,
has prevented my writing to you before. You, and yours, and all my dear
_Scotch_ friends, have been, still are, and by the grace of GOD always
will be much upon my heart. I long to hear that their souls prosper.
Perhaps next Spring I may pay them another visit. The remainder of this
year must be spent in visiting _England_ and _Wales_. Blessed be GOD,
there is a prospect of a revival where I have been already, at _London_,
_Bristol_, and _Wales_, from whence I am just now come. Our LORD hath
been pleased to lift up the light of his countenance upon his poor
people. I beg, reverend Sir, the continuance of your prayers, that I
may be stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the LORD.
At present, through grace, I am willing to spend and be spent for the
good of precious and immortal souls. My native air seems to improve my
health, and I trust ere long I shall be lively and strong as an eagle.
I suppose you have heard that the word of the LORD has been glorified
in _Bermudas_. In a short time, I hope the adjacent islands will know
what it is to feel the sun of righteousness arising with healing under
his wings.

              _Blest is faith that trusts his power,_
              _Blest are saints that wait his hour;_
              _Haste, great conqueror, bring it near;_
              _Let the glorious close appear._

Reverend Sir, I could write more; but must away. I beg my most cordial
respects may be accepted by your whole fire-side and all friends. I
intend writing to dear Mr. _M――――_ soon. In the mean while, I must
haste to subscribe myself, reverend and very dear Sir,

     Your most affectionate, obliged younger brother, and willing
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCLXI.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                           _London, August 10, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

THIS morning, just after I had begun to put pen to paper, a friend told
me, that since I had been in the country, a letter had been sent me
by a lady out of _Scotland_. I opened it, and with a pleasing surprize
found it was from your Ladyship, to whom I was then writing. Blessed
be GOD, that your soul, honoured Madam, is yet held in life! I hope
it does and will prosper; and however others may grow lukewarm and
lose their first love, yet you will say, “As for me and my household,
we will serve the LORD.” By four years fresh experience, I find that
this indeed, in every respect, is the whole of man. O how good has the
blessed Redeemer been both to my soul and body! Out of how many and
great deaths has he delivered me! And yet, honoured Madam, vile as I
am, he is pleased still to honour me. Multitudes flock to hear the word,
and our LORD is pleased to administer seed to the sower. Early in the
Spring, GOD willing, do I purpose to visit dear _Scotland_ once more.
That the LORD of all Lords may abundantly bless your Ladyship, and all
your connections in this and a better world, is the earnest prayer of,
honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most obliged, obedient humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. J――――._

                                           _London, August 11, 1748._

_My very dear Mr. J――――_,

YOUR kind letter, which I received but yesterday, having been taking
a little tour in the country, both grieved and pleased me. Glad was I
to find, that my dear old friend had not forgotten me, and yet sorry
as it were, that I had not wrote to him first. I was just going to put
pen to paper, when yours was brought to my hands. I read it with joy,
and now embrace the first opportunity of answering it with the greatest
pleasure. These words concerning our LORD have always been weighty
on my heart, “Having loved his own, he loved them unto the end.”
They therefore that are most like him, will be most steady in their
friendship, and not very readily given to change. O my dear Sir, what
has the Redeemer done for us since we used to take such sweet counsel
together at _Oxford_! Blessed be his name for giving you a heart still
to preach among poor sinners the unsearchable riches of CHRIST. May
you go on and prosper, and, maugre all opposition, see Dagon fall every
where before the ark. As for me, I am a poor worthless pilgrim, and
thought long ere now to be with him, who has loved and given himself
for me.――But it seems I am not yet to die, but live. O that it may
be to declare the work of the LORD! I think this is the thirteenth
province I have been in within this twelvemonth, in each of which our
LORD has been pleased to set his seal to my unworthy ministry. I came
from _Bermudas_ last, where I left many souls seeking after JESUS of
_Nazareth_. In _London_, _Bristol_, _Gloucester_, and _Wales_, the
glorious _Emmanuel_, since my arrival, has appeared to his people. In
about a fortnight I purpose leaving town again in order to go a circuit
of about five hundred miles. I need not desire you to pray for me; I
need not tell you how glad I shall be whenever opportunity offers, to
see you face to face. In the mean while, let us correspond by letter.
May JESUS bless it to us both! I return cordial respects to Lady
_M――――_. I pray the LORD to bless her and her little nursery. For the
present adieu. I am, my very dear Mr. _J――――_,

                              Ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXIII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                           _London, August 16, 1748._

_Dear Sir_,

GLAD shall I be to have the pleasure of your dining with me on
_Thursday_ between twelve and one. If you please, you may leave your
chaise and horses at the other end of the town, and ride to my lodgings
in an hackney coach. Or if you choose to come in your chaise, we have
inns near at hand. I shall devote _Thursday_ afternoon to you; and if
you please to stay the evening and hear me preach, and then sup and
take a bed at our house afterwards, I shall be much obliged to you.
You need only enquire for the tabernacle new house near _Moorfields_.
I hope matters will be so ordered, that you will be _solus cum solo_.
I pity persons in your circumstances, and humbly hope that you will be
one of _Nicodemus_’s children every way. You know, though he came by
night at first, yet afterwards he was as bold as a lion. Go on, dear
Sir: “To him that hath, shall be given.” CHRIST will not quench the
smoaking flax, nor break the bruised reed. That his love may be shed
abroad in your heart, that you may be enabled to confess him before men,
and be confessed by him before his Father and the holy angels in heaven,
is the earnest prayer of, dear Sir,

        Your most affectionate friend, and willing servant for
                             JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXIV.


                            _To Lord ――――._

                                            _London August 19, 1748._

_My Lord_,

THOUGH I expect to be in _Scotland_ in about three weeks, yet I cannot
defer writing to your Lordship any longer. I hope this will find your
worthy lady trampling upon the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh,
and the pride of life, and steadily pursuing the one thing needful.
I doubt not but you both have found, that the Redeemer’s service has
been perfect freedom, and that in keeping of his commandments there
is even a present great reward. Blessed be GOD, I can say so by happy
and repeated experience. The blessed JESUS is pleased still to own and
bless my poor labours, and gives me encouragement to go on fighting his
battles. My outward man decays; but I trust I shall die in the field of
battle. I want to learn what it is to be a good soldier of JESUS CHRIST.
I could enlarge, but multiplicity of business obliges me to be brief. I
hope my most dutiful respects will find acceptance with good Lady ――――,
Lady ――――, and all your Lordship’s fire side.――That you all may be
filled with the fulness of GOD, is the hearty prayer of, my Lord,

            Your Lordship’s most obliged, obedient servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCLXV.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                           _London, August 20, 1748._

_My very dear Brother_,

I Thank you for your kind letter. It was put into my hands just as I
was leaving _Bristol_, and ever since, I have been so busy, that till
now I could not redeem a few moments to answer it. I am glad that you,
and the dear brethren you mentioned, are so well and happy. They are my
old hearty friends as well as you. I salute them tenderly, and long for
that time when we shall all surround the throne, and throw our crowns
before the Lamb who sitteth thereon for ever. There we shall be all
unisons: there we shall have clear heads, and perfectly clean and
purified hearts. Till then we must agree, to disagree in many things,
except to love and serve him, who loved us and gave himself for us, who
has redeemed us unto GOD by his blood, hath made us kings and priests
unto GOD, and enables us to reign over sin, death, and hell, even
whilst we are here on earth. O glorious mystery! Well may the angels
desire to look into it. I could enlarge, but other affairs of our
LORD’s kingdom call me away. For the present, adieu. I return your
cordial salutations in the heartiest manner. If our LORD should call
me to _Wiltshire_, I would come and see you. At present I am bound to
_Scotland_. I trust we can say, JESUS is with us here. That he may be
evermore with you and all his sincere followers, is the earnest prayer
of, my very dear brother,

     Yours most affectionately in him that was dead, but is alive
                    again, and liveth for evermore,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXVI.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                                   _August 21, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Received your Ladyship’s letter late last night, and write this
to inform your Ladyship that I am quite willing to comply with your
invitation. As I am to preach, GOD willing, at _St. Bartholomew_’s on
_Wednesday_ evening, I will wait upon your Ladyship the next morning,
and spend the whole day at _Chelsea_. Blessed be GOD, that the rich and
great begin to have an hearing ear. I think it is a good sign that our
LORD intends to give to some at least, an obedient heart. Surely your
Ladyship and Madam _E――――_ are only the first fruits. May you increase
and multiply! I believe you will. How wonderfully does our Redeemer
deal with souls. If they will hear the gospel only under a cieled roof,
ministers shall be sent to them there. If only in a church, or a field,
they shall have it there. A word in the lesson, when I was last at
your Ladyship’s, struck me. “_Paul_ preached privately to those that
were of reputation.” This must be the way I presume of dealing with
the nobility, who yet know not the LORD. O that I may be enabled, when
called to preach to any of them, so to preach as to win their souls to
the blessed JESUS! I know your Ladyship will pray that it may be so.
As for my poor prayers, such as they are, your Ladyship hath them every
day. That the blessed JESUS may make your Ladyship happily instrumental
in bringing many of the noble and mighty to the saving knowledge of his
eternal Self, and water your own soul every moment, is the continual
request of, honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most obliged, obedient humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXVII.


                           _To Judge B――――._

                                           _London, August 22, 1748._

_Honoured Sir_,

I Think it is now high time for me to send you a line of thanks, for
the favours you was pleased to confer on me when at the _Bermudas_.
They are not, and I trust never will be forgotten by me, whilst I am
on this side eternity. The same good hand that was with me abroad,
hath safely brought, and since my arrival blessed me much at home. I
am daily employed in that delightful work of preaching to poor sinners
the unsearchable riches of JESUS CHRIST. Once a week I read prayers and
preach in one of the largest of the _London_ churches. Multitudes flock
there and in the fields, and I trust much good is done to many. I have
been lately a three hundred mile circuit, and purpose, GOD willing,
to set out for _Scotland_ in about eight days. At my return, I hope
to hear by some ship or another that all is well at _Bermudas_. I beg
my most dutiful respects may find acceptance with his Excellency. I
endeavoured to be as obliging as I could to his lady and little master,
whom I suppose the Governor will have heard from before this comes
to hand. I have taken the freedom to send him a volume of my sermons.
I intend writing to Colonel _H――――_ another opportunity. I have sent
to Colonel _G――――_ and some others already. Multiplicity of business
prevents my writing to more at present. Be pleased however to present
my most cordial respects to him and his family, to your whole fire side,
and all enquiring friends. I hope you will accept the same yourself,
from, honoured Sir,

                   Your most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCLXVIII.


                       _To Captain J―――― D――――._

                                           _London, August 22, 1748._

_Very dear Sir_,

I Have already written to you and other friends since my arrival at
_London_. With this, I send a box of books to be disposed of among my
dear _Bermudas_ acquaintance. To some I have affixed their names, and
lest I should have forgotten any (as undoubtedly I have, being so much
hurried) I have sent half a dozen of my volumes of twenty three sermons,
to be disposed of with the small tracts, as you shall think proper.
I begin now to expect the _Diana_, or some other ship, to bring me an
account of the welfare of you and my other beloved friends. A sense of
your manifold kindnesses lies yet upon my heart, and I always endeavour
to remember them before Him, who has promised that a cup of cold water
given in the name of a disciple, shall in no wise lose its reward. Had
I time equal to my will, I would write many letters, but a variety of
business prevents. Be pleased therefore to beg my friends to accept
general thanks and cordial salutations. In a few days I purpose setting
out for _Scotland_, and hope to return to _America_ next year. But
future things belong to GOD. A wide scene opens here, and I would
willingly be disposed of as seemeth best to my heavenly Father. To his
tender and never-failing mercy, do I earnestly commend you and dear
Mrs. _D――――_, your little ones, all your relations, and the whole
circle of my friends. That you may be blessed with all the blessings of
the everlasting covenant, is the hearty desire and continual prayer of,
very dear Sir,

           Your most affectionate, obliged friend and humble
                               servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXIX.


                            _To Mr. ――――._

                                           _London, August 22, 1748._

_Very dear Sir_,

IF any thing I have said or written has been made any way serviceable
to your better part, I thank the LORD of all Lords, whose mercy
endureth for ever. I trust the language of my heart towards JESUS
CHRIST, is this:

                _If thou excuse, then work thy will,_
                  _By so unfit an instrument;_
                _It will at once thy goodness shew,_
                  _And prove thy power omnipotent._

I thank you, dear Sir, for your concern about my health. If it should
please GOD to bring me back from _Scotland_ to winter in town, I have
thoughts of submitting to some regimen or another. At present I think
it impracticable. On _Tuesday_, GOD willing, I purpose to set out,
and to go by the way of _York_. I suppose it will be about a two
months circuit. My journals, and last five sermons, I shall send to
Mr. _D――――_, with the journal that I have corrected. Alas, dear Sir,
so many things want altering, that what you propose for _Andrew_ to
do, would be for him a too laborious task. I heartily wish that you
and doctor _D――――_ and Mr. _H――――_ would be pleased to revise them.
I intend publishing a new edition soon. Mr. _H――――_ is of a different
opinion from Dr. _D――――_ concerning the seventh of the _Romans_.
_Adhuc sub judice lis est._ I always do as you desire in respect to
Mr. _W――――_’s sermons. My prayer for him, for myself, and friends, is
this; “LORD, give us clear heads and clean hearts.” I would recommend
bishop Beveridge’s sermons more, but they are too voluminous for the
common people, and I have not read them all. I expect you will do
this yourself, dear Sir, by and by, from the pulpit, and what is more,
recommend his and your master to the choice of poor sinners. You have
now by your excellent letter publickly confessed him. The eyes of all
will be now upon you, to see whether the truths you have delivered to
others, are transcribed into your own heart and copied in your life.
Now indeed may you cry,

                _O for a strong, a lasting faith!_
                _To credit what the Almighty saith!_

Now the language of your soul should be, “how holy ought I to be in all
manner of conversation and godliness.” Now, dear Sir, let me entreat
you to keep from trimming, or so much as attempting to reconcile two
irreconcilable differences, GOD and the world, CHRIST and _Belial_. You
know me too well to suppose I want you to turn cynic. No, live a social
life. But then, dear Sir, beg of the LORD JESUS to free you from the
love of the world; thence, thence arises that fear of man which now so
shackles and disturbs your soul. Dare, dear Sir, to be singularly good.
If CHRIST be your Saviour, make him a present of your pretty character.
Honour him, and he will honour you. He indulges you much, and gently
leads you on. Let the same love constrain you, dear Sir, to press
forwards, and never rest till you can give up children, name, life, and
all into his hands who gave his precious blood for you. I could enlarge,
but am called away. I make no apology for this; you say you are my
friend.――Accept this, dear Sir, as a token of my believing you sincere
in that profession, from

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCLXX.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                           _London, August 22, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

EVER since the reading your Ladyship’s condescending letter, my
soul (as indeed through grace it was in a degree before) has been
overpowered with his presence, who is All in All. When your Ladyship
stiled me “your friend,” I was amazed at your condescension. But when
I thought that JESUS was my friend, it quite overcame me, and made me
to lie prostrate before him, crying, Why me, why me? I just now rose
from the ground, after praying the LORD of all Lords to water your
soul, honoured madam, every moment. As there seems to be a door opening
for the nobility to hear the gospel, I will defer my journey till
_Thursday_, and, GOD willing, preach at your Ladyship’s on _Tuesday_.
In the mean while I will wait upon or send to the Count the _Danish_
embassador’s brother, who favours me with his company on _Monday_ to
dine. On _Monday_ morning from nine to near eleven I will be at your
Ladyship’s, and wait to know your order concerning _Tuesday_. O that
GOD may be with and make me humble! I am ashamed to think your Ladyship
will admit me under your roof, much more am I amazed that the LORD
JESUS will make use of such a creature as I am. Under a sense of this,
I write to your Ladyship now. It is late, and my poor body calls to
rest. But as I am to preach four times to-morrow, I thought it my duty
to send these few lines to your Ladyship to night. Quite astonished at
your Ladyship’s condescension, and the unmerited superabounding grace
and goodness of Him who has loved me and given himself for me, I
subscribe myself, honoured madam,

          Your Ladyship’s most obliged, obedient, humble and
                           willing servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXXI.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                             _London, Sept. 1, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

ALTHOUGH it is time for me to be setting out, yet I dare not leave
town without dropping a few lines, gratefully to acknowledge the many
favours I have received from your Ladyship, especially the honour you
have done me in making me one of your Ladyship’s chaplains. A sense
of it humbles me, and makes me to pray more intensely for more grace,
to walk more worthy of that GOD, who has called me to his kingdom and
glory. As your Ladyship hath been pleased to confer on me the honour
before mentioned, I shall think it my duty to send you weekly accounts
of what the LORD JESUS is pleased to do for and by me. Glory be to
his great Name, the prospect is promising. My Lord _Bath_ received me
yesterday morning very cordially, and would give me five guineas for
the orphans, though I refused taking any thing for the books. I send
your Ladyship (by the hands of faithful and honest _Betty W――――_) a
little box of my sermons, and the last account of GOD’s dealing with
me, and of the money expended for the Orphan-house, with my oath before
the magistrates of _Savannah_. The little book in marble paper is for
Madam _P――――_: I have folded down where I would have her begin to read.
What a lovely christian will she make, when grace hath once refined
her heart? I hope GOD intends to honour your Ladyship in making you
instrumental of doing good to the nobility. His providence, his
peculiar providence hath placed your Ladyship at _Chelsea_. I am
persuaded your Ladyship will not quit that post, till he that hath
placed you there, plainly gives you a dismission. I have good news
to-day from _Bristol_. Mr. _C――――_ intends to be fettered no longer
with the fear of man. O that there may be always in him such a mind! Mr.
_L――――_, he informs me too, is coming from under the cloud. He begs his
dutiful respects may be presented to your Ladyship, and is much obliged
to your Ladyship for being so much concerned for him. I hope he will
fix by and by: But whither am I running? Pardon me, honoured madam, I
fear I am too bold and too long. Upon the road, I propose writing your
Ladyship my thoughts of what scheme seems to be most practicable, in
order to carry on the work of GOD, both here and in _America_. I dare
add no more but my hearty prayers for the temporal and eternal welfare
of your Ladyship, and whole houshold, and subscribe myself, honoured
madam,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXXII.


                    _To the Rev. Mr. J―――― W――――._

                                             _London, Sept. 1, 1748._

_Rev. and dear Sir_,

MY not meeting you at _London_ has been a disappointment to me. But our
LORD orders all things well. His time is and will be best. I suppose
you will hear of my preaching to some of the nobility, and I trust the
hour is coming when some of the _Mighty_ and _Noble_ shall be called.
What have you thought about an union? I am afraid an external one is
impracticable. I find by your sermons, that we differ in principles
more than I thought, and I believe we are upon two different plans.
My attachment to _America_ will not permit me to abide very long
in _England_; consequently, I should but weave a _Penelope_’s webb,
if I formed societies; and if I should form them, I have not proper
assistants to take care of them. I intend therefore to go about
preaching the gospel to every creature. You, I suppose, are for
settling societies every where; but more of this when we meet. I can
now only say a few general things. I hope you don’t forget to pray for
me. You are always remembered by, Reverend and dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCLXXIII.


                         _To Mr. J―――― W――――._

                                             _London, Sept. 1, 1748._

_My very dear Brother_,

YOUR kind letter I received with great satisfaction. I chearfully
sit down to answer it before I set out for _Scotland_. I have been
a mile or two upon the road, but turned back because my chaise was
not registered. My hands have been full of work, and I have been
among great company. A privy counsellor of the king of _Denmark_,
and others, with one of the Prince of _Wales_’s favourites, dined and
drank tea with me on _Monday_. On _Tuesday_ I preached twice at Lady
_Huntingdon_’s to several of the nobility. In the morning the Earl of
_Chesterfield_ was present. In the evening Lord _B――――_. All behaved
quite well, and were in some degree affected. Lord _C――――_ thanked me,
and said, “Sir, I will not tell you what I shall tell others, how I
approve of you,” or words to this purpose. He conversed with me freely
afterwards. Lord _B――――_ was much moved, and desired I would come and
see him the next morning. I did; and his Lordship behaved with great
candour and frankness. All accepted of my sermons, and seemed surprized
but pleased. Thus, my dear brother, the world turns round. “In all time
of my wealth, good LORD deliver me!” Glad am I, for his own sake, that
dear Mr. _C――――_ begins to resolve to play the man. Alas! a ♦trimming
conduct is uncomfortable to one’s self, displeasing to CHRIST, and
ridiculous in the sight of the world. CHRIST is worth all, or he is
worth nothing. May the LORD enable me to be simple, and honest, and
open in all my dealings, and to trust him with the consequences. I have
ever yet found, that honesty is the best policy in the end. O that dear
Mr. _L――――_ may at length show himself a man too! My dear, very dear
brother, may you lose no more time, but join in confessing a crucified
Saviour. Glad am I to find that Mr. _C――――_’s conversation is blest to
you. I wish you had always a christian _fidus achates_ at your side.
Pardon me, dear brother, this freedom. My love is so great to you,
and I have put up so many prayers for you, that I cannot rest till you
improve those excellent parts GOD has given you, for the glory of his
church and the good of his people. I am glad you will send something
to our mother. I need not tell you, that the wisest of men has bid us
“not to despise one’s mother, when she is old.” I thank you for the
pictures; I have made free with some of them already. I shall not be
sorry, if you do not go to _Gloucester_. Alas, so much money spent at
music-meetings will make but a poor article at the day of judgment.
But where does my affection carry me? My dear brother, good night. GOD
willing, you shall hear from me soon again; if you do not answer me
immediately, I will impute it to any thing rather than want of love;
that, I am sure, is strong towards me, however unworthy of it. GOD has
blessed me much in _London_. Congregations are very large. On _Sunday_
I was enabled to preach four times: but this body――Well! thanks be to
GOD, it is soon to be put off. Once more good night. My love to all
friends. I am

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._

                            LETTER DCLXXIV.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                          _Oulney, (Northamptonshire) Sept. 4, 1748._

_Very dear Sir_,

IT was a pleasing surprize to me last week, to receive a letter dated
in _July_ from my dear, very dear friend Mr. _S――――_ of _New-England_.
I left town yesterday, but having an immediate opportunity of sending,
by way of _Philadelphia_, I now sit down to write your answer. Poor
_New-England_! I pity and pray for thee from my inmost soul. May GOD
arise, and scatter thy enemies! may those that hate thee be made to
flee before thee! I am afraid the scene will be yet darker. But you
know it is always darkest before day-break. It has been so in _England_.
Matters, as to religion, were come to almost an extremity. The enemy
had indeed broken in upon us like a flood. The spirit of the LORD is
now lifting up a standard. The prospect of the success of the gospel,
I think, was never more promising. In the church, tabernacle, and
fields, congregations have been great, and perhaps as great power as
ever hath accompanied the word. A door is also opening for the mighty
and noble. I have preached four times to several of the nobility at
good Lady _H――――_’s. All behaved exceeding well, and I suppose in the
winter opportunities of preaching to them will be frequent. May the
LORD prepare me for whatever he has prepared for me! As for returning
to _America_, if I live, I believe there’s no doubt of it. I intend
keeping myself free from societies, and therefore I hope to see you
again next year. But future things belong to GOD. I thank you and dear
Mr. _R――――_ for your kind invitation. May the LORD direct to what is
best! I hope you will continue to write. Pray read, seal and send the
inclosed. You will communicate so much of this letter as may be proper.
O dear Sir, pray for me, that the glorious _Emmanuel_ may give me
humility, and lead me on from conquering to conquer. You must remember
me to dear Mrs. _S――――_ and all in the kindest manner, and entreat them
to continue their prayers in behalf of, very dear Sir,

                            Yours as usual,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXXV.


                            _To Mr. R――――._

                                             _Oulney, Sept. 4, 1748._

_Very dear Sir_,

THOUGH I am on my journey to _Scotland_, yet I must stop a little by
the way to answer your kind letter dated in _July_ last. It brought
strange things to my ears, and it made me smile. You know, dear Sir,
what has often passed between you and me, upon that point, loving
honour. Some persons being forced as it were to accept of government
places, are like other persons saying _nolo episcopare_, when, it may
be, they have been making interest for a bishoprick many years. You
know how to make the application. However, GOD may over-rule this for
good, and if you could get the government of ―――― (though in asking for
it, you know not what you ask) it might be of service to _New-England_
many ways. But, dear Sir, what can I do in it? I have no interest at
court, and supposing I had, you have directed me to no means, neither
hath any person been with me concerning it. Be pleased therefore to
inform me of particulars. Let Mr. _S――――_ instruct me what steps are to
be taken, and if I can be of any service, you may command me. I thank
you, dear Sir, for your kind invitation, and if you are to be exalted,
I pray the LORD of all Lords to fit and qualify you for, and support
you under it. You will not forget to give my most cordial salutations
to all my dear _New-England_ friends. I pray for them, you, and yours,
and am, very dear Sir, with repeated thanks for all favours,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXXVI.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. L――――._

                                          _Doncaster, Sept. 7, 1748._

_Rev. and dear Sir_,

OUR last short interview at _Stone-house_ pleased me. I hope it
foreboded something good. I told you the truth when I said, “I had not
forgotten you.” No, neither have I been suffered to think hardly of you
for your shyness to unworthy me; only I have thought you were loosing
time, and for fear of displeasing a few mortal men, had acted a part
displeasing to the invisible, immortal, and only wise GOD. Good Sir
_John Philips_ used to call you _sincere_. I believe that is your
right name. I cannot help thinking but you will prove it to be so
ere long. That love which JESUS shed abroad in your heart years ago,
must constrain you to confess him before man. The light which the LORD
hath imparted to you, cannot, I am persuaded, be much longer hid under
a bushel. The shackles with which you have been fettered, must be
shaken off, or I am much mistaken in the dear man to whom I am writing.
――Pardon me, my dear old friend. My heart at present overflows with
love towards you. Though weary and on a journey, I cannot help writing
to you. Fear not temporal support. Though I went without scrip or shoe,
I have lacked nothing; or if I had nothing; in JESUS I have possessed
all things. I do not envy those who choose to sleep in a whole skin.
Let me have scars, so that they are scars of honour, scars for JESUS
CHRIST. I know who will approve of them, when he comes to judgment. O
that day! that awful day! GOD enable us so to act, that we may receive
an _Euge bone_! Out of the fulness of my heart I write thus. I am now
on my way to _Scotland_. The LORD JESUS hath blessed me in _London_. As
soon as possible I intend calling upon you. If you have a mind to renew
our old delightful christian correspondence, I am quite willing. I wish
you and yours the best of blessings, and am, very dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCLXXVII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                         _Morpeth, (Northumberland,) Sept. 10, 1748._

_Dear Mr. S――――_,

TILL now I have not had time to answer your kind letter, and now I am
too weary to send you a long one. I thank you for your good wishes and
prayers. May they enter into the ears of the LORD of Sabaoth! Hitherto,
GOD has been pleased to bless me since my arrival. Let the LORD’s
people continue to hold up their hands, and by his divine assistance
I will go on fighting till I drop. I am now on my way to _Scotland_.
I know you wish me good luck in the name of the LORD. When providence
opens a door, I shall be glad to embrace.――In the mean while, pray
remember me to all in the kindest manner. As for your call to preach,
I can say nothing, being a stranger to you. Only I would observe to you
what the apostle says, “Not a novice, &c.”――You know what follows. If
you chuse proper seasons, and keep within the bounds of humility and
christian prudence, I pray the LORD to be with and bless you. I can now
add no more, but subscribe myself

                 Your affectionate friend and servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCLXXVIII.


                            _To Mr. T――――._

                                         _Edinburgh, Sept. 15, 1748._

_Dear Mr. T――――_,

ERE this can reach _London_, you will find that I have forgot not my
promise. No, I love thee too well to do so. Thanks be to GOD, that you
begin to awake out of your dream. It has been a dream, though a golden
pleasing one. If all was right, such darkness would never come and
abide upon your soul. Come, play the man, and, if called to it, leave a
worm for GOD. You are not the first that have been called to part with
what was as dear as their own souls, or that have seen their beloved
object in the possession of another. Better see that, than enjoy
the object with guilt upon the mind. How did _Jacob_ smart, all his
life-time afterwards, for getting the blessing by a lie? The way of
duty is the way of safety. I write this on supposition that your father
will be against your proceeding. You will let me know what he says: In
the mean while, as our LORD enables, I will pray for you. May the LORD
JESUS give us a right judgment in all things! But enough of this. You
see the bishop’s charge has turned out as I supposed. Who could imagine
otherwise? LORD, humble thy people for giving such wrong touches to
the ark! LORD, keep me from doing so any more! O for zeal according to
knowledge! O for grace and wisdom to act aright! Yesterday GOD brought
me safe here, and I have been received very kindly. This afternoon I am
to preach. The effects of it you may know hereafter. For the present,
adieu. I recommend you to Him who is able to keep you from falling, and
to raise you when fallen; and subscribe myself,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

                                         _Edinburgh, Sept. 16, 1748._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

ON _Thursday_ noon, through the providence of a good and gracious GOD,
I came hither, where I have met with an hearty welcome. Last night I
preached to a _Moorfields_ congregation for numbers, and the LORD, I
believe, was pleased to give it his blessing. I have had the pleasure
of hearing, that a serjeant of a regiment, awakened when I was here
last, held on, and held out, and died rejoicing; and likewise of
several others, who are gone before us to inherit the promises. May the
LORD awaken fresh souls to supply their places. I trust he will. I was
also much delighted last night, to hear there were so many christian
soldiers among the king’s forces that came from _Flanders_. A young
christian lady, under whose roof they were, told me, that some or other
of them were continually praying to, and wrestling with GOD. If any of
them return to _England_, I doubt not but Col. _G――――y_ will find them
out. I intend writing to him soon, and hope to send our good lady some
glad tidings next week. In the mean while, pray present my most dutiful
respects to her Ladyship. I hope all is well in _London_. The bishop’s
death, I suppose, will prevent any further stir about _Bartholomew_.
I shall be glad to hear how you go on. Pray, dear Sir, how are your
circumstances? You will not be offended if I inform you, that more than
one have informed me of your being in debt to several. I thought it
my duty to apprize you of it, because I know what a burden it is to be
in debt; not indeed for myself, but for others. I make no apology for
this; you know it must proceed from love. I wish you the very best of
blessings, and am, reverend and dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXXX.


                         _To Mr. S―――― W――――._

                                         _Edinburgh, Sept. 19, 1748._

_My very dear Mr. W――――_,

SHALL I promise, and not perform? GOD forbid! Glad am I, yea very glad
to open a fresh correspondence with a dear old friend, with whom I
have often taken such sweet counsel. O my dear man, how patient, how
long-suffering has the blessed JESUS been towards us! Ought not his
love to constrain us to obedience? Ought we not to confess him, who
endured such contradiction of sinners against himself for us? For my
part, when I think that the glorious _Emmanuel_ endured the pain, and
despised the shame of dying upon a cursed tree for me, I cannot help
saying,

              _For this let men revile my name,_
              _No cross I’d shun, I’d fear no shame;_
              _All hail reproach, and welcome pain,_
              _Only thy terrors, LORD, restrain_.

Glory be to GOD, I have hitherto found that the cross of JESUS has
been lined with love. This has made it easy; this even now makes it
exceeding light. I fear prosperity more than affliction; and though
there is but little danger perhaps of my being exalted in this world,
yet the language of my soul is, “In all time of my wealth, good LORD
deliver me.” May the LORD keep you, my dear friend, by his mighty power
through faith! He has entrusted you with many talents; may you occupy
them till he come! I hope he will bless your conversation to those who
are yet but weak in the faith, and who cannot, through love of the
world, or fear of man, as yet bear much contempt. My service to Messrs.
_B――――_ and _M――――_, when you see them. My prayer for you all is, that
you may be good soldiers of JESUS CHRIST. I am fighting for him here.
Vast multitudes come to hear; but what good is done, cannot yet be
determined. Many of my dear friends are gone to glory, I purpose being
in town about the time appointed. I know you will pray for me. Whether
absent or present, assure yourself you are never forgotten by, my very
dear friend,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

                                         _Edinburgh, Sept. 20, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Suppose, ere this can reach you, your Ladyship will have heard of
my being arrived at _Edinburgh_, and of another particular or two
mentioned in Mr. _B――――_’s letter. This brings your Ladyship an account
of very great multitudes flocking to hear the word; but with what
success it is attended, I cannot yet tell. Upon my first coming, I was
somewhat discouraged at hearing of the death of many of my valuable
and leading friends, and of others losing their first love. Besides,
the weather was boisterous, some ministers shy, and GOD was pleased to
visit me with a great hoarseness. But the prospect is now more pleasant;
and I trust, ere I leave _Scotland_, your Ladyship will have some good
news from a far country. Inclosed your Ladyship has an extract of a
letter sent from _London_ to a pious gentlewoman here: I wish part of
the contents may not prove, like the bishop of _E――――_’s charge,――mere
imaginary. May GOD hasten the time, when more of the mighty and noble
shall be called, and made to stoop to the Redeemer’s sceptre! It is now
growing late. That your Ladyship and family may be filled with all the
fulness of GOD, is the earnest prayer of, honoured Madam,

          Your Ladyship’s most obedient, willing servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCLXXXII.


                            _To Mr. H――――._

                                         _Edinburgh, Sept. 21, 1748._

AND could my very dear Mr. _H――――_ think, that when he was out of
sight he was out of mind? No, my dear friend, I believe it will never
be so with you and me. By this time, I hope Mr. _D――――_’s letter
from _Bermudas_, or the letters sent you from thence by way of
_Philadelphia_, will inform you, that I wrote several parting letters
to you and many other friends, and sent you bills of exchange to the
amount of _eighty pounds_ sterling; but, with my letter, books, and
several other things, I find they are taken. Of this Mr. _D――――_ writes
me lately. As there is now peace, and a commerce opened with _Spain_,
I hope the new settlers will be disturbed no more. Courage, my dear
man, courage. Surely we shall yet live to see the salvation of GOD
in _Georgia_. I am glad Mr. _Fairweather_ hath been at _Bethesda_.
Whatever has happened, do your best for me in respect to my family.
Next year you may see me again. But more of this hereafter. The LORD
is exceeding good to me. Great things are doing in _England_; and the
LORD is blessing me more and more in _Scotland_. This morning, I hear
a gentlewoman has left me an hundred pounds. If so, fifty shall be paid
for you on the Orphan-house account, to Mr. _N――――_, and as much more
as I can spare, as soon as possible.――I have paid Mr. _J――――_ thirty
pounds sterling. But what does my wife tell me in her letter received
this day, about your losing some favourite creature? Is it your wife,
or your little daughter? Well, my dear friend, you and I must be made
perfect through sufferings; you and I must learn to walk by faith. May
the Father of Mercies comfort your heart, and abundantly supply the
want of every creature, by communications from his own eternal Self.
O pray write to me. Let me bear part of your sorrows, and thereby shew
myself your friend. If my wife is embarked ere this arrives, I beg you
would open all parcels that are sent to your care, and act as usual for
my family. My tender love to all. You will not cease praying, dear Mr.
_H――――_, for

                            Ever yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCLXXXIII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                         _Edinburgh, Sept. 23, 1748._

_My dear Brother S――――_,

HOW good is GOD! Well may you say, that he never fails those that put
their trust in him. How does he make my extremity his opportunity to
help and relieve me. If the news about the legacy be true, I hope it
will increase my faith, and make me more willing to be upon the stretch
for Him, who was stretched upon the accursed tree for me. I thank you
for sending my letters. My wife proposes to embark for _England_ in
_October_. The climate will not agree with her. The physicians advise
her to come over, and she entreats all friends to pray for her safe
passage to _England_. Affairs here have now a comfortable aspect. I
think more people than ever come to hear, and their hearts begin to
be warm. Continue to write. My love to all. The not sending the late
published account of the Orphan-house, has been of disservice to me.
When will the children of light be as wise in their generation as the
children of the world? I can now no more, but am, my dear Sir,

                              Ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCLXXXIV.


                         _To Colonel G――――ly._

                                         _Edinburgh, Sept. 23, 1748._

_Very dear Sir_,

EVER since I have been in _Edinburgh_, I have been attempting to write
to you, but could not effect it till now. Though I am absent from,
yet I am present with you. I hope this will find you fighting the good
fight of faith, and in every respect behaving like a good soldier of
JESUS CHRIST. The news of your conversion hath reached the ears of many
of the great ones in _Scotland_. May the LORD JESUS keep you stedfast,
unmoveable, always abounding in his work. The way you know. A constant
looking up to the author and finisher of our faith, and watching unto
prayer with all perseverance, will keep the soul steady amidst all the
temptations of a malicious devil, and ensnaring world. O for grace and
zeal to endure unto the end! _Finis coronat opus._ I could say much,
but company waits for me. Vast multitudes come to hear, and I trust
much good is done. Good Lady _H――――_ has an extract of a letter from
a soldier, which will please you. Here are two devout soldiers in
_Edinburgh_. May the LORD JESUS add more to his church of such converts
as may be saved! You will not forget to pray for me. That you may
increase with all the increase of GOD, is the earnest prayer of, very
dear Sir,

                  Your most affectionate friend, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCLXXXV.


                            _To Mr. H――――._

                                           _Glasgow, Sept. 28, 1748._

_My very dear Mr. H――――,_

YOU are every day upon my heart. I must not, I cannot refrain writing
to you any longer. How do you? Old love revives in my heart towards you,
because, I trust, love to the blessed JESUS begins to revive in your
heart. May the glorious _Emmanuel_ fan the divine spark, till it break
out into a holy blaze! Do not lose one moment more, my dear Sir: let
this be the language of your soul continually,

              _Be gone, vain world, my heart resign,_
              _For I will be no longer thine:_
              _A nobler a diviner guest_
              _Now takes possession of my breast._

It pleases me to think, how loud you and I shall sing of infinite,
free, and unchangeable love in heaven; for because GOD changeth not,
therefore you and I have not been consumed. O pleasant, transporting
thought! What a saviour is JESUS of _Nazareth_! How precious was his
blood! How profusely, as it were, was it shed for sinners! That you
and yours may every moment feel its pardoning, renovating, cleansing,
and purifying power, is the earnest prayer of, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCLXXXVI.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                           _Glasgow, Sept. 28, 1748._

_My very Dear Sir_,

I Have been in pain because your kind letter has lain by me so long
unanswered.――Nothing but a variety of other necessary business has been
the cause. My hands are full, and I trust the pleasure of the LORD will
prosper in them. Very great multitudes have flocked to hear; and in
_Glasgow_ the prospect of doing good is rather more promising than in
_Edinburgh_. In a fortnight I purpose, GOD willing, to leave _Scotland_,
and to preach at _Oundle_ in my way to _London_. Glad shall I be to
see two such friends as you and Mr. _H――――_, though incog. I will
endeavour to send you timely notice. I would have neither of you expose
yourselves to needless contempt upon my account. I think I can say,
that I am willing to be forgotten even by my friends, if JESUS CHRIST
may thereby be exalted. But then, I would not have my friends act an
inconsistent part towards that friend of all, that friend of sinners,
the glorious _Emmanuel_. You know, my dear Sir, what an inspired
apostle hath asserted: “A double-minded man is unstable in all his
ways.” Whilst you are afraid of men, you will expose yourself to a
thousand inconveniences. Your polite company, (unless you converse with
them more as their physician, than as their companion) will prevail on
you to such compliances, as will make you smart when you retire into
your closet, and reflect on the part you have acted. Before I shook off
the world, often have I come out of company, shorn of all my strength,
like poor _Sampson_ when he had lost his locks! But this is a tender
point. Go on, dear Sir, and prove the strength of JESUS to be yours.
Continue instant in prayer, and you shall see and feel infinitely
greater things than you have seen or felt yet. I am of your opinion,
that there is seed sown in _England_, which will in time grow up into
a great tree. GOD’s giving some of the mighty and noble a hearing ear,
forebodes future good. I do not despair, if I live, of seeing you a
proclaimer of the unsearchable riches of JESUS CHRIST. GOD be praised,
that Mr. _H――――_ is so bold an advocate for his blessed LORD. I send
him my most affectionate respects, and entreat him to remember me in
his prayers. I wrote to Mr. _H――――_ lately. I herewith send you an
extract of a letter I wrote on ship-board to my dear invaluable friend
Mr. _S――――_, of _South-Carolina_. If it was judged proper, I would put
it in the preface of a new edition of my Journals. I would not have
any of my mistakes remain uncensured, uncorrected. I thank you for your
hint about my way of preaching. I shall take care to observe it. And
now, dear Sir, for the present, adieu. I am afraid I have tired you. I
shall be fond of seeing you at _London_. Rejoicing in the prospect of
seeing you in the kingdom of heaven, I subscribe myself, very dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER [♦DCLXXXVI.]

                                           _Glasgow, Sept. 28, 1748._

_Dear Sir_,

WHEN I was the other day at _Edinburgh_, your aged father communicated
a letter to me, which gave an account of your being translated from
the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of GOD’s dear Son. As the
news rejoiced the hearts of angels in heaven, no wonder that it gives
satisfaction to those who desire to follow the blessed JESUS here on
earth. Hoping that I am one of those, and being willing to promote his
glorious gospel in every part of the world, I write you this letter at
a venture, to wish you joy of your happy change, and to exhort you with
full purpose of heart to cleave unto the LORD. The more you know of
Wisdom’s ways, the more you will find them to be ways of pleasantness.
The more you know of the blessed JESUS, the more you will find that
his yoke is easy, and his burden exceeding light. Go on then, dear Sir:
be strong in the grace that is in CHRIST JESUS, and learn to endure
hardness like a good soldier. Who knows what the LORD may do by you
in the dark parts where you are? Much good has been done among the
soldiers in _Flanders_. What GOD has done for your soul, I trust is
only an earnest of what he intends to do for others in _St. Helena_. I
salute your companion very heartily. I wish you both much prosperity in
the LORD. You shall have the prayers of as many as I can engage for you.
Remember our LORD’s promise. Where there are only two or three gathered
together in his name, there is he in the midst of them. Though you have
not public ordinances, yet if the GOD of ordinances be with you, there
will be no room for complaint. If I can any way be instrumental of
promoting the blessed work begun among you, you may readily command,
dear Sir,

         Your most affectionate friend and willing servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                           LETTER DCLXXXVII.


                           _To Mrs. E――――._

                                           _Glasgow, Sept. 28, 1748._

_Dear Madam_,

ALTHOUGH I fear it may be taking too much freedom, yet as I humbly hope
that the love of GOD is shed abroad in your heart, I trust you will
not be offended at my sending you these few lines. They are lines of
joy; for who can help rejoicing that hears what the blessed JESUS hath
done for your soul? O Madam, how much are you indebted to that grace
which hath made such difference between you and others. To see any one
converted is a miracle. But to see a rich person, one of the mighty,
one of the noble converted, is yet a greater. May the LORD JESUS add
more of your rank to his church, such as shall be saved! Never fear,
Madam; all things are possible to the glorious _Emmanuel_. Let him but
speak the word, and great shall be the numbers of new creatures. I hope
this will find you in good health, and upon the full stretch for him
who was stretched and bled upon the cross for you. Great multitudes in
_Scotland_ flock to hear. Some of my spiritual children, I hear, are
gone to heaven, and others come to me, telling what GOD did for their
souls when I was here last. I desire to cast my crown before the Lamb;
I desire always to be crying out, “Why me, LORD, why me?” In about a
fortnight I purpose setting out for _London_. I lead a moving life. In
heaven I shall have rest enough. Blessed be GOD for giving us to enter
into a little of that rest even here! That you may daily increase in
faith, and consequently enjoy more and more of this rest, is the hearty
prayer of, dear Madam,

                   Your most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCLXXXVIII.


                      _To some devout Soldiers._

                                           _Glasgow, Sept. 29, 1748._

_My dear Brethren_,

IT gave me no small satisfaction, when I was lately at _Edinburgh_,
to hear that several of you were enabled to behave like good soldiers
of JESUS CHRIST. I rejoice greatly that you are made partakers of his
grace, and I earnestly intreat the LORD of all Lords that you may grow
and increase in it day by day. This is the christian’s duty. He must
forget the things that are behind; he must press forward towards the
things which are before; he must not stop, till he arrives at the
mark of the prize of his high calling. I trust, my dear brethren, you
are all thus minded; and that whatever befals you, you will, through
divine assistance, hold on and hold out to the end. If I can be any
way serviceable to you, be not backward to send to me. I hear of others
of your profession, that have lately enlisted under the banner of the
ever-blessed Redeemer. Happy they! happy you! You have a good captain,
a good cause, good armour, and an exceeding great reward. That you
may at all times quit yourselves like men, and be strong; that you may
fight the good fight of faith, and at length lay hold on life eternal
is the hearty prayer of, my dear Brethren,

           Your affectionate friend, and willing servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCLXXXIX.

_Honoured Madam_,

AM I not too troublesome in writing to your Ladyship so frequently?
I fear I am; and yet I am afraid to break your Ladyship’s command,
“Write weekly.” Blessed be GOD, I can yet send your Ladyship word
that the glorious _Emmanuel_ is with me, and countenances my poor
administrations. I have met with some unexpected rubs, but not one more
then was absolutely necessary to humble my proud heart. “O my blessed
Redeemer, when shall I learn of thee to be meek and lowly! Thou alone,
O Lamb of GOD, canst teach me. Sanctify all thy dispensations to this
end, and give me always to lie at thy feet.” There, honoured Madam, I
am safe: There I believe this letter will find your Ladyship.――May you
every moment hear the Redeemer’s voice, and be built up continually in
your most holy faith. In about a fortnight I purpose leaving _Scotland_.
Several things concur to make me believe that it was right for me to
come here. Particulars your Ladyship may expect at my return to town.
In the mean while, I recommend your Ladyship, and your dear offspring,
with your whole houshold, to the care of the Father of mercies and the
GOD of all consolation, and am, honoured Madam,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._

                            _To Dr. H――――._

                                             _Glasgow, Oct. 1, 1748._

_My dear Doctor_,

YESTERDAY with great satisfaction I received your kind letter. Being in
_Scotland_, I cannot as yet have the pleasure of seeing Captain _T――――_;
but, GOD willing, I shall enquire him out at my return to _London_.
The GOD of the seas and the GOD of the dry land has brought me safe to
my native country; since which I have written to you and many others,
and left two boxes of books for my dear _Bermudas_ friends, to be
sent the first opportunity. Although GOD is pleased to smile upon my
poor administrations, and very great multitudes flock to hear both
in _England_ and _Scotland_, yet I have thoughts of seeing _Bermudas_
again next year. But I dare not determine. Future things belong to GOD.
Glory be to his great name for sending me to _Bermudas_ at all! Glory
be to his great name, that you, my dear Sir, are striving to enter
at the streight gate of a sound conversion. I hope you will never
cease striving, till you know that your Redeemer liveth.――Neither the
greatness nor number of your sins can keep you from this unspeakable
privilege, if you believe on the LORD JESUS. He is the way, the truth
and the life. Come to the Father in and through him, and you, even you
shall be made more than conqueror. Ere this can reach you, I hope you
will have received redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness
of your sins. When you experience this, O how will you rejoice with joy
unspeakable, even with joy that is full of glory! You will then have
an heaven upon earth. Sin shall not have dominion over you. It shall
not reign in your mortal body. My dear Mr. _H――――_, whilst I am musing
on, and writing about this blessed change, this present salvation, the
fire kindles. I love you with a peculiar love. I travail in birth till
JESUS CHRIST be formed in your dear heart. O do not backslide. Study to
improve the light and grace already received. “To him that hath shall
be given,” and he shall have abundance. But I forget myself. Busy as I
am, I must, you see, write a long letter. Pray return my hearty love to
your dear wife, Mrs. _H――――_’s mother in law, &c. &c. May grace, mercy
and peace be multiplied upon you all! I hope you will omit no
opportunity of writing to, my very dear Friend,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCXCI.


                            _To Mr. A――――._

                                             _Glasgow, Oct. 1, 1748._

_Dear Mr. A――――_,

I Am not disappointed of my hope. I thought the LORD JESUS had begun
a good work in your soul before I left the _Bermudas_. Your welcome
letter confirmed me in this opinion. I received it with joy. Though
I wrote to you not long ago, yet I must answer yours immediately.
And what shall I say? May I not welcome you into the world of new
creatures? May I not hope that there has been joy in heaven over you,
even you, my dear Man, repenting and turning unto GOD, even a GOD
in CHRIST? Surely I may. And what then does the LORD now require of
you, now he hath shewn you that good thing, the pardon of your sins,
through a once crucified but now exalted Redeemer? Will you not, out
of a principle of gratitude, do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly
with your GOD? Methinks I hear you say, “I will, I will through the
LORD JESUS CHRIST strengthening me.”――And he will strengthen you.――He
has promised, that as our day is so shall our strength be.――Despised
you must be, and your name shall be cast out as evil; but the glorious
Redeemer will enable you to go without the camp, and cause you to
rejoice when loaded with his sacred reproach. “Increase and multiply,”
must now be your motto. Strive as much as in you lies, by your life
and conversation, to win others to the blessed GOD. The eyes of men
and angels will now be upon you. May the LORD enable you to walk
circumspectly to those that are without. I hope your wife and all your
relations will join in going to heaven with you. I return them my most
hearty love, and pray that they may be filled with all the fulness
of GOD. You will join in praying me over to the _Bermudas_ again.
I suppose Dr. _H――――_ will shew you his letter. Remember me in the
kindest manner to all, and accept this as a token of love unfeigned,
from, dear Mr. _A――――_,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

WHO is like unto GOD, who makes his creatures extremity, the
opportunity to help them? Your kind letter hath confirmed the news of
the death of Mrs. _B――――_, and of her leaving me a legacy of a hundred
pounds. Well! though she is gone, yet I shall meet her at the great
day, when the LORD JESUS shall remember this and all her other works of
faith, and labours which have proceeded from love. I am glad she has
left such an executor; I doubt not of your taking care of my interest.
Your love is founded upon the rock of ages, and so is mine; for indeed
I love you and yours in the bowels of the dear Redeemer. I know you
will be glad to hear of my prosperity in this work. Indeed GOD makes
way for his own gospel. Many come to me, telling me what the LORD did
by me the last time I was in _Scotland_, and also the time before.
Congregations are very large. I am pressed to stay three or four
days more than I intended. Some that were prejudiced, have had their
prejudices removed, and I believe will be greater friends than ever.
O that I was humble and thankful! I have good news from _Bermudas_. I
return you and yours love and thanks. I desire to be remembered to dear
Mrs. ―――― and every inquiring friend. As I need them so much, I hope
none will cease putting up earnest prayers in behalf of, very dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXCIII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                             _Glasgow, Oct. 3, 1748._

_My dear Sir_,

I Thank you for your kind letter. I am so ill with a hoarseness and
cold, and in straining to reach large congregations, that I must send
you but a short answer. The depending upon CHRIST’s immediate teachings,
without making use of books and proper means of instruction, you may
assure yourself is a _terrible temptation_. It is the very quintessence
of enthusiasm, and will lay you open to a thousand delusions. “Give
thyself to reading,” says _Paul_ to _Timothy_. If thou cannot think of
being a _Latin_, strive to be an _English_ scholar. At my return I will
endeavour to assist you. At present I am quite ill; but I am afraid
I shall not be able to leave _Scotland_ in less than a fortnight. You
must remember me to all. The LORD JESUS has appeared for me.
Particulars expect to hear another time.

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXCIV.


                            _To Mr. ――――._

                                             _Glasgow, Oct. 5, 1748._

_Very dear Sir_,

I Received yours this morning; though I am engaged this evening, yet
I think it my duty to send you an immediate answer. You might well
inform, and almost assure, _my Lord of Exeter_, that I knew nothing of
the printing of his Lordship’s pretended charge, or of the pamphlets
occasioned by it. When the former was sent to me in manuscript from
_London_ to _Bristol_, as his Lordship’s production, I immediately said,
it could not be his. When I found it printed, I spoke to the officious
printer who did it out of his own head, and blamed him very much. When
I saw the pamphlet, I was still more offended; repeatedly in several
companies I urged the injustice as well as imprudence thereof, and said
it would produce what it did, I mean a declaration from his Lordship,
that he was no Methodist. I am sorry his Lordship had such an occasion
given him to declare his aversion to what is called Methodism; and
though I think his Lordship in his declaration hath been somewhat
severe concerning some of the Methodist leaders; yet I cannot blame
his Lordship for saying, “that he thought some of them were worse than
ignorant and misguided,” supposing that his Lordship had sufficient
proof, that they either caused to be printed, or wrote again when
printed, a charge which his Lordship had never owned nor published.
If you think proper, dear Sir, you may let his Lordship see the
contents of this. I will only add, that I wish a way could be found out,
whereby his Lordship and other of the Right Reverend the Bishops, might
converse with some of us. Many mistakes might thereby be rectified,
and perhaps his Lordship’s sentiments in some degree altered. If this
cannot be effected (I speak only for myself,) I am content to wait till
we all appear before the great shepherd and bishop of souls. In the
mean while, I heartily pray, that their Lordships may be blessed with
all spiritual blessings, and wishing you the like mercies, I subscribe
myself, very dear Sir,

              Your affectionate, obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._

                            _To Mr. H――――._

                                          _Cambuslang, Oct. 9, 1748._

_My dear Mr. H――――_,

HAVE you not suspected, that I have forgotten you? but indeed I have
not. As a testimony of it, though late, accept a line of love, even
love unfeigned. I hope you are well, and that affairs go on at the
Tabernacle as well as can be expected. I trust the shout of a king is
amongst you. Blessed be GOD, he has caused his gospel to triumph in
_Scotland_. I have been humbled and exalted; humbled first, in order to
be exalted afterwards. Thus it is.――The LORD wounds and then heals. At
present I am in the place where the great awakening was about six years
ago. The fruits of it yet remain. To morrow, GOD willing, I take my
leave at _Glasgow_. I believe we shall have a sorrowful parting. As I
expect to stop in _Yorkshire_, I suppose I cannot reach _London_ till
the latter end of this month, if so soon. O for a warm winter! You must
remember me to all. I cannot now descend to particulars. I can only
pray, that you and yours may be filled with all the fulness of GOD, and
subscribe myself,

           Yours most affectionately in the glorious JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._

                                          _Edinburgh, Oct. 12, 1748._

_My dear Sir_,

LAST night, after wondering at your being silent so long, I received
your wished-for letter. The reading it brought tears from my eyes. I
felt for you, and for your father, and for all parties concerned. How
lovingly does the LORD deal with you? Is not the way of duty the way
of safety? Should you not both agree to let matters lie as they are,
and not go one step farther till you know your father’s mind? You have
given him your word; you must not go back. My affair came to as near
a crisis, and yet I was called to sacrifice my _Rachael_. It may not
be so with you. But prepare for the worst. Assure yourself, that your
present passion, at least as to the excess of it, is sinful. If all is
right, why such uneasiness for such a small space of time? Why such a
long eclipse in the soul? Alas! _B――――_’s has been almost total. I hope
you are now coming out of it. Thanks be to that JESUS, who has promised
“that we shall not be tempted above what we are able to bear,” but will
with the temptation make a way to escape. You see, my dear man, my love
by my sympathy and plainness. Pray remember me to your aged father in
the kindest manner. Dear old man! he is worthy of your greatest regard.
His account of the legacy is true.――Yes, my dear friend, the LORD
JESUS does reign indeed, and therefore I shall be delivered out of all
my troubles. You will give thanks in my behalf. He has appeared for
me here. Congregations have been very large, and several things have
concurred to prove that providence did indeed call me to _Scotland_.
I would not but have come for the world. Last night I came hither
from _Glasgow_, and thought to leave this place as next _Tuesday_, but
perhaps it may be the _Tuesday_ following. I fear I cannot write to any
more this post. But whether I write or not, whether absent or present,
you must always remember me, as

      Your assured friend, and willing servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXCVII.


                            _To Mr. W――――._

                                          _Edinburgh, Oct. 12, 1748._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

THOUGH I have not written to you, yet not one day hath passed since my
being this time in _Scotland_, without my thinking of you. The love and
respect I owe you, as an aged minister of JESUS CHRIST, will not suffer
me to be silent any longer. How do you, reverend Sir? I doubt not but
you find that promise true, “The righteous shall bring forth much fruit
in old age.” This leaves me, though faint, yet pursuing, and resolved,
in the blessed JESUS, to spend and be spent in the blessed cause
wherein I have embarked. Indeed, when I consider my blunders, mistakes,
and imprudencies, I wonder the glorious _Emmanuel_ does not lay me
aside; but his grace is like himself, _infinite_ and _eternal_. I hope
he has given me a sight of, and humbled me for some of my mistakes;
and I trust as I grow in years, if I am to live longer, I shall grow in
knowledge and every christian virtue. Reverend and dear Sir, be pleased
to pray for me. I do not forget you, though perhaps you may judge
otherwise. O for heaven! There christian ministers shall see eye to
eye.――But I must not weary you. In a few days I suppose you will hear
what has happened in the _West_. Dear Mr. _M――――_ perhaps may acquaint
you with particulars. With this, I send you a few of my last accounts
of the Orphan-house. You may dispose of them as you think proper.
When you see Mr. _B――――_ or _R――――_, or any of the ministers that
were friendly to me, be pleased to remember me to them in the most
respectful manner. I hope Mrs. _W――――_ and your whole houshold enjoy
much of Him whose presence is better than life. I earnestly entreat
the LORD to fill you with all his fulness, and beg leave to subscribe
myself, reverend and dear Sir,

        Your most affectionate, though unworthy younger brother
                     and servant in JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCXCVIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. E――――._

                                          _Edinburgh, Oct. 12, 1748._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

BY the providence of a good and gracious GOD, I came hither last night,
after having preached at _Falkirk_ in the morning. Mr. _A――――_ behaved
very kindly. Mr. _N――――_ has Mr. _M――――_’s letter. I am to see him at
five this evening. On _Tuesday_ next, GOD willing, I intend preaching
for Mr. _G――――_, and to leave _Scotland_ the _Tuesday_ following. In
the mean while you may write what you please. But whither am I going?
Let GOD direct. Let my name be forgotten, let me be trodden under the
feet of all men, if JESUS may thereby be glorified. I wish you or Mr.
_M――――_ would write a line to Mr. _W――――_; I would not have any good,
though mistaken man, uneasy upon my account. Well! In heaven all will
be over. When I meet you there, I will thank you for all the pains you
have taken with, reverend and dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCXCIX.


                     _To the Countess of H――――n._

                                          _Edinburgh, Oct. 15, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

THOUGH it is late and nature calls for rest, yet I cannot with
satisfaction close my eyes unless I write once more to your Ladyship:
and what shall I say? I am the chief of sinners, and the LORD JESUS
magnifies his grace in being long suffering and infinitely bountiful
unto me. At _Glasgow_ he has magnified his strength in my weakness,
and out of the eater hath brought forth meat. Next week I purpose, GOD
willing, to send your Ladyship the substance of a long debate about
poor unworthy me, in the synod of _Glasgow_. Since that, I find the
presbytery of _Perth_ (I mean the new-fashioned part of it) has made an
act against employing me. Ill-nature shews itself here, but I feel the
benefit of it. Congregations are large, and I am enabled to preach with
greater power, and feel unspeakable great comfort in my own soul. My
hoarseness is quite gone off, my bodily health much repaired, and if my
enemies shew themselves, I am persuaded the blessed JESUS will bless me
to his people more and more.――Some give out, that I am employed by the
government to preach against the _Pretender_; and the _Seceders_ are
very angry with me for not preaching up the _Scotch Covenant_. Blessed
be GOD, I preached up the covenant of grace, and I trust many souls
are taught to profit. The inclosed, dear Madam, will shew your Ladyship
a little how I have been dealt with. Particulars your Ladyship shall
have when the LORD is pleased to bring me to _London_. Next _Tuesday_
sevennight I am to leave _Scotland_. Lady _Mary H――――_, Lord _L――――_
and Lady _F――――_ beg their compliments may be presented to your
Ladyship. Many in _Scotland_ pray most earnestly for you, and Mr.
_R――――_ intends writing your Ladyship a letter. I pray for you,
honoured Madam, continually. I am quite happy in Him who died upon the
cross to save me. I believe he will deliver me out of all; and if I die
for him, so that I am not suffered to deny him, it will exceedingly
please, honoured Madam,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                              LETTER DCC.


                            _To the Same._

                                            _Topcliff, Nov. 1, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

THUS far has a gracious and good GOD brought me in my way to _London_,
which I hope to reach some time next week. Your Ladyship may expect to
see me the next day I come to town. Thanks be to the LORD of all Lords
for directing my way to _Scotland_. I have reason to believe some have
been awakened, and many, many quickened and comforted. My old friends
are more solidly so than ever, and a foundation I trust has been laid
for doing much good, if ever the LORD should call me thither again.
Two synods and one presbytery brought me upon the carpet; but all has
worked for good. The more I was blackened, the more the Redeemer
comforted me. I desire to cry, Grace! grace!

              _The love of CHRIST doth me constrain,_
              _To seek the wandering souls of men;_
              _With cries, entreaties, tears, to save,_
              _And snatch them from the gaping grave._

              _For this let men revile my name,_
              _No cross I’d shun, I’d fear no shame;_
              _All hail reproach, and welcome pain,_
              _Only thy terrors, LORD, restrain_.

At present I add no more, but my most dutiful respects to your Ladyship,
and with hearty prayers for your temporal and eternal welfare, I beg
leave to subscribe myself,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCI.


                            _To Mr. R――――._

                                            _Topcliff, Nov. 1, 1748._

_My dear Friend_,

HERE, with thankfulness of heart, will I set up my _Ebenezer_; for
hitherto assuredly hath the LORD helped me. We reached _Fetton_ on
_Saturday_ night. There being no public worship on the Lord’s-day, I
came on to _Morpeth_ to worship there; got to _Ferry-hill_ on _Monday_
evening, and to-night am writing at _Topcliff_. Though I do not preach,
yet I hope I am preparing for it. Reading, prayer, and meditation are
three necessary ingredients. Riding, and getting proper rest, have
recruited me; but I am apt to believe I have strained myself inwardly.
I feel sensible pain in my breath.――But no matter; it is for a good
master, who bore inexpressible pain for me.

              _O LORD, enlarge my scanty thought,_
              _To see the wonders thou hast wrought;_
              _Unloose my stammering tongue to tell,_
              _Thy love immense, unsearchable_.

I could write much, but my body calls for rest. My very dear Sir,
good night. May the LORD of all lords reward you, and my other dear
honoured friends, a thousand-fold. I intend writing to more very soon.
In the mean while, pray present my sincerest respect and thanks to all.
Inclosed you have Mr. _M――――_’s letter and my answer. Be pleased to
shew what Mr. _M――――_ and Mr. ―――― writes, and let them tell you how
the affair between them was. I know you will act as a peace-maker. That
the GOD of peace and love may dwell and rule in your dear heart, is the
earnest prayer of, my very dear friend,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCII.


                    _To the Honourable Lady D――――._

                       _Wantsworth (Northamptonshire), Nov. 5, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

THOUGH I am now eighty miles from _London_, yet gratitude, and the
unfeigned respect I bear to you and yours, will not suffer me to go
any further, without sending your Ladyship my repeated acknowledgments
for your very many and repeated favours. Your kindnesses, when last at
_Edinburgh_, were indeed surprizing. They have often humbled me, and
as often led me to the throne of grace in behalf of your Ladyship and
honoured family. May the promise made to those who are not ashamed of
CHRIST, his gospel, and ministers, descend upon you all! O that you may
have grace given you to shine as lights in the world, and to dare to be
singularly good, since it is too apparent that we live in a wicked and
adulterous generation. Honoured Madam, let us look up: as our day is,
so shall our strength be. All things are possible to those that believe.
May the LORD JESUS evermore give your Ladyship and children a large
share of precious, purifying, operative faith! This is the earnest
desire of my soul. Upon this I could enlarge, but travelling wearies
me. Thanks be to GOD, I have that place in view, where the weary are
at rest. In a post or two I purpose writing to my Lord _B――――_, his
honoured lady, &c. I never forget any of them. They have my constant
prayers and most cordial respects. Be pleased to accept the same,
honoured Madam, from

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCIII.


                            _To Lady ――――._

                                             _London, Nov. 10, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Wrote a line to dear Mr. _R――――_, when about the middle of my journey.
I must write a line to you, now the LORD of all lords hath brought me
to the end of it. I trust I can say, JESUS was with me on the way. My
health was sensibly improved; but, by sitting up late to preach, I am
grown little sick again. Good Lady _H――――_ is come to town, and I am
to preach at her Ladyship’s house twice a week to the Great and Noble.
O that some of them may effectually be called, and taste of the riches
of redeeming love! I need not inform your Ladyship, that this, and
this alone, can give true rest and peace to any soul. You have felt the
beginnings of it. May you experience an increase of it more and more.
I desire my most tender and affectionate respects may find acceptance
with dear Mr. _R――――_, and with all who are pleased to honour me with
their acquaintance. That grace, mercy, and peace may be multiplied upon
you, is the continual prayer of, honoured madam,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCIV.


                           _To Lord R――――._

                                             _London, Nov. 10, 1748._

_My Lord_,

I Believe I am not mistaken, in thinking that your Lordship will not
be offended with me for sending you a short letter. It is the effect
of that unfeigned love I bear to your honoured father, yourself, and
that dear and honourable family with which your Lordship is now so
closely allied. And what shall I say? Can I wish your Lordship any
thing greater, than that you may be a good soldier of JESUS CHRIST. It
is a blessed thing to be engaged in fighting his battles; and not only
to be almost, but altogether a christian. It is this half-way religion
that undoes the professing world. The heart can never be at unity with
itself, till it is wholly centered in GOD. This can only be done by
faith in JESUS CHRIST; and when once a soul begins to taste of this
faith, then that soul’s heaven begins on earth. I trust I can say this
by happy experience. I wish your Lordship a very large share of it; and
with hearty acknowledgments for all favours, beg leave, to subscribe
myself, my Lord,

        Your Lordship’s most obedient, obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._

_Honoured Madam_,

THOUGH absent from, yet I am not unmindful of you. The regard your
Ladyship has been pleased to shew to a poor unworthy worm, calls for
and claims my sincerest and most repeated acknowledgments. This letter
brings them, and shall be followed, honoured Madam, as the LORD enables,
with fervent prayers for your temporal and eternal welfare. O that
you may be enabled to make a stand this winter for the LORD JESUS, and
not in the least countenance any of those diversions that have already
brought religion so low in poor _Scotland_! I need not inform your
Ladyship, what a blessed thing it is to be singularly good, and to be
consistent in our whole walk and conversation. To be uniform, and all
of a piece, is the very life of a christian. It is this, and not a
compliance with the polite world in any of their fooleries, that will
gain proselytes to JESUS CHRIST. I could enlarge on this head, but I
am persuaded it is needless for your Ladyship. The glorious JESUS hath
let you see too much of his love, for you ever to be taken up with
any thing short of his own eternal life! That he may knit your heart
yet closer to himself, he is pleased to visit you with crosses. They
are the christian’s portion, honoured madam: They are the believer’s
birthright. “In the world you shall have tribulation;” but what
follows? “Be not afraid, I have overcome the world.” Look, therefore,
to Him, honoured madam, who, as he hath been the author, will also be
the finisher of your faith. That you may increase with all the increase
of GOD, is the earnest prayer of, honoured madam,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

OUR bountiful and good GOD brought me here in safety the beginning
of this week. I have already waited upon, and preached at good Lady
_H――――_’s. About thirty have desired to come, and I suppose they will
bring thirty more. I have heard of two or three more dear christians
among the _Great Ones_. I know you will pray the LORD of all lords to
increase the number. Her Ladyship hath a great regard for all those in
_Scotland_, who stand up for vital religion. She intends to send you
down the picture of poor _Aaron_ the late negroe preacher. I find the
public papers give strange lying accounts of my reception in _Scotland_.
At present, blessed be the glorious JESUS, I am content to be blackened.
I send you my repeated thanks for all favours; and, with hearty love to
dear Mr. _G――――_, your family, and all friends, I subscribe myself,
reverend and very dear Sir,

       Your most affectionate, obliged, though unworthy younger
                 brother and servant in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCVII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. S――――._

                                             _London, Nov. 12, 1748._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

BY my not hearing from you with my wife’s letter, I suspect you are
not yet reconciled to my leaving _America_, though but for a season.
Every thing concurs to prove that I have done the will of GOD. As I am
streightened in time, I will refer you to the inclosed, which I desire
you will read, seal, and send. Here are loud calls; but I think to
come over to you again next year. Pray write to me. I will endeavour
to answer you. I wrote to you lately from _Scotland_. Not a day passes,
but I think of you and my other _Charles-Town_ friends. I intend to
write to you very soon. In the mean time, be pleased to remember me to
all in the most tender manner. Ere this can reach you, I expect to see
my wife in _England_. I purpose to persuade her to settle here. I want
to make the Orphan-house a seminary of learning. If some such thing be
not done, I cannot see how the _Southern_ parts will be provided with
ministers. All are afraid to come over. May the LORD JESUS direct me.
I believe he will. Pray remember me to Mr. _Z――――_, Mr. _O――――_, &c. if
with you. I have not time at present, or otherwise they should have a
line from, reverend and very dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCVIII.


                      _To the Countess of H――――._

                                             _London, Nov. 14, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

THE inclosed brings good news from a far country. The person’s
mother belongs to the Tabernacle society: I lay at his house when in
_Virginia_; but he and others went to cards, I thought on purpose to
affront me. We retired to prayers for him. I hope they were heard. Your
Ladyship will be pleased to let me have the letter again; as likewise
that I sent to your Ladyship from _Scotland_, from one Capt. _K._ of
St. _Helena_. Your Ladyship shall have copies of them all. I am getting
the _New-England Christian History_, and _Bishop Hall’s Works_ in folio,
bound for your Ladyship. I find there has been a great stir in the
synod of _Edinburgh_ about unworthy me. Mr. _W――――_, Mr. _J――――_, Mr.
_R―――― W――――_, have protested against their proceedings, and appeared
quite hearty. Your Ladyship wrote to Mr. _R――――_. A word or two of
encouragement now from your Ladyship, would strengthen the hands of
these ministers of CHRIST. I hear the affair is to come before the
assembly next _May_. News also was brought me last night, that the
negroes are allowed by the trustees for _Georgia_. If so, that province,
under GOD, will flourish. Blessed be GOD, I am more hearty than I have
been for a long season. I hope to be enabled to preach here on _Sunday_
evening, and to come and preach at your Ladyship’s afterwards. Last
night the gospel was indeed preached with the Holy Ghost sent down
from heaven. I was shewing the dignity of a christian, and in what
sense christians were kings. The King of kings was amongst us. When
I hear or receive any thing that is new and good, I naturally inform
your Ladyship of it, because I believe it will give your Ladyship
satisfaction. I hope your new house is agreeable to your Ladyship.
That the Redeemer’s glory may fill it, and that it may prove a gate
of heaven to many of the rich and great, is the earnest prayer of,
honoured madam,

                         Your Ladyship’s, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCIX.


                    _To the Honourable Lady T――――._

                                             _London, Nov. 19, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

WHEN I was lately in _Scotland_, Col. _G――――ly_ wrote me word, that
your Ladyship was pleased to desire my poor prayers. Before his writing,
they had been put up to the throne of grace in behalf of your Ladyship
very frequently; and I would then have written to your Ladyship, had
I not feared it would have been making too free. Yesterday good Lady
_H――――n_ informed me that your Ladyship was ill. Had I judged it proper,
I would have waited upon your Ladyship this morning. But I was cautious
of intruding. However, the regard I bear to your Ladyship, constrains
me to inform your Ladyship, that my heart’s desire and prayer to GOD
is, that this sickness may not be unto death, but to his glory, and
the present and eternal good of your better part, your precious and
immortal soul. This, no doubt, is the end of afflictions: GOD’s name
and nature is Love. He cannot, therefore, chastise us for any other
purpose, than that we may be made partakers of his holiness.――Every
cross and disappointment, every degree of pain, brings this important
call with it, “My son, my daughter, give me thy heart.” O that your
Ladyship’s soul may echo back, “My heart, LORD JESUS, will I give.”
O that from a feeling, spiritual, abiding sense of the vanity and
emptiness of all created good, you may, in a holy resentment, cry out,

              _Be gone, vain world, my heart resign,_
              _For I must be no longer thine:_
              _A nobler, a diviner guest,_
              _Now claims possession of my breast!_

Then, and not till then, will your Ladyship’s mind be at unity with
itself. Then, and not till then, will your Ladyship, upon truly
rational principles, with chearfulness wait for the approach of death,
and the coming of the LORD from heaven. It is faith in JESUS, a true
and living faith in the Son of GOD, that can alone bring present, real
peace, and lay a solid foundation for future and eternal comfort. I
cannot wish your Ladyship any thing greater, any thing more noble, than
a large share of this precious faith: and a large, yea a very large
share, is the glorious Redeemer ready to give to all that sincerely ask
for, and seek after it. He waits to be gracious. He giveth liberally;
he upbraideth not. When, like _Noah_’s dove, we have been wandering
about in a fruitless search after happiness, and have found no rest
for the sole of our feet, he is ready to reach out his merciful hand,
and receive us into his ark. This hand, honoured madam, is he reaching
out to you. May you be constrained to give your heart entirely to him,
and thereby enter into that rest which remains for the happy, though
despised people of GOD. But whither am I going? I forget that your
Ladyship is indisposed, and I almost a stranger to you. I will only
make this apology: “The love of JESUS constrains me.” Hoping, therefore,
your Ladyship will excuse the freedom I have here taken, I beg leave to
subscribe myself, honoured madam,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCX.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. P――――._

                                             _London, Nov. 19, 1748._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

IT is a concern to me, that I cannot write to more of my _New-England_
friends than I do; for indeed a multiplicity of business renders a more
frequent correspondence impracticable. However, I would willingly send
you, dear Sir, a few lines. They are lines of love, and bring you news
of my being better in health than I have been for many years last past.
Several things have concurred to prove it was the divine will I should
return this time to my native country. Matters were in great confusion
by reason of Mr. _C――――_’s going over to the _Moravians_; but blessed
be GOD, we are now easy at the Tabernacle, and the word falls with
weight and power. In _Scotland_ the LORD JESUS was pleased to appear
for me; I found no diminution in respect to the number of hearers; and,
I believe, (thanks be to free grace) my preaching was more acceptable
than ever to GOD’s people, and to those ministers who were pleased
formerly to own and encourage me. Some of the opposite party begun a
like stir with that which was made in _New-England_ by Dr. _C――――_, &c.
but I believe it will only make the people more eager to hear, and in
the end be productive of great good. Our LORD orders all things well. I
never enjoyed more settled peace and joy than now. I trust he has given
me to see many things that were wrong, and withal a disposition to
confess and amend them. At present, this is the language of my heart:

                  _Correct me when I go astray,_
                  _And lead me in the perfect way._

I suppose you will be acquainted with particulars by some of my dear
friends from _Scotland_. In all probability I shall go to _Scotland_
again in the Spring; and, in the latter end of the year, I propose
embarking for _America_. But future things belong to GOD. Thanks be to
his great name, I am willing to go any where, so that I may but glorify
the dear Redeemer. Ere this reaches you, doubtless you will have heard
of his giving me favour in the sight of Lady _H――――n_, a Lady as good
as she is great. Two or three among the great, I trust have been made
the happy subjects of redeeming love. I have heard lately also of
the conversion of two or three clergymen; there is likewise a great
awakening in _Ireland_, and in _Wales_ the work goes on. Upon the
whole, I believe the gospel is getting ground, and next spring, when
it is proper to range about and preach in the fields, I hope to see
yet greater things. I repeat my old request, reverend and dear brother,
“Pray for us.” I continually pray for you, and the people committed to
your charge. I wish you and yours an increase of blessings, and beg
leave to subscribe myself, Reverend and very dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCXI.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. L――――._

                                             _London, Nov. 19, 1748._

_My very dear Brother_,

WORDS cannot well express what I felt when your welcome letter came to
hand. It drew me to my knees; it made me shed tears of joy, and with
two or three of my dear friends I was enabled to wrestle for you at
the throne of grace. Blessed, for ever blessed be the GOD and Father
of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, for opening your eyes, and giving you such
an experimental and soul-ravishing knowledge of the doctrine of grace.
No wonder that people take notice of you. I hope the fame thereof, as
it hath reached heaven, will also be spread abroad upon the earth, and
thro’ the thanksgivings of thousands redound to the glory of GOD. I
think it a happiness, that you are surrounded with many souls that have
indeed tasted that the LORD is gracious, and consequently will be fed
with the sincere milk of the word, now communicated to them, under GOD,
by you. Now, my dear friend will you begin to live, now will you begin
to preach indeed. Go on in the name of JESUS, and as _Paul_ did, so
shall you, “increase with all the increase of GOD.” Glad shall I be
to give you all the assistance that lies in my power. _Henry on the
Scriptures_ will now suit your taste, and _Jenks upon the Righteousness
of CHRIST_ might do you immediate service. _Flavel’s Sermons_ would
be food for you, and _Boston upon the Covenant_, and his _fourfold
State_, I believe would delight you. _Bishop Hall’s Contemplations_ are
excellent, _Bishop Hopkins_ and _Beveridge_ will do for you, and indeed
almost all the writers a century ago. The doctrines you now preach are
no new doctrines; you are now got into the good old way. May the LORD
keep and succeed you in it, ever more and more. I believe he will. I
could say more, but I expect another letter from you before I come down.
Lady _H――――_ is rejoiced to hear of you. I read part of your letter
to her last night before I preached. Some of the great ones hear the
gospel gladly. That you may be made a very great blessing to thousands
and ten thousands, is the hearty prayer of, my dear Mr. _L――――_,

                              Ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXII.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. P――――._

                                             _London, Nov. 21, 1748._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

I Was glad to hear, by a letter sent by Mr. _R――――_, that you had been
in _New-England_. I hoped you would have come further, even to Old
_England_ and _Scotland_. I have been endeavouring in _Scotland_ to
do all the service I could to the _Indian_ school and the _New-Jersey_
college whilst I was there; but I believe nothing will be done to
purpose unless you or some other popular minister come over, and make
an application in person. In all probability, a collection might then
be recommended by the general assembly, which sits next _May_, and
large contributions be raised among private persons that wish well to
_Zion_. If one of the Indians was brought over with the minister, and
a proposal made to educate some of the late awakened _Indians_ in the
_New-Jersey_ college, it would certainly be of service. Mr. _M――――_
and several other faithful ministers are hearty in the affair; but I
believe will do nothing, unless you or some other such like minister
come over. Probably I shall be in _Scotland_ next spring again. GOD
has been pleased to countenance me there; and some of the clergy, in
order to stop my progress, have followed Dr. _C――――y_’s example. But
if GOD be for us, who can be against us? Thanks be to his holy name,
I am kept quite chearful in soul, and healthy in my body. Blessed be
GOD, the word falls with weight, and I hear of several brought under
fresh convictions. A clergyman or two have been lately converted,
and there is a great awakening in _Ireland_. I shall be glad to hear
that _New-York_ is full of new creatures. I beg that my most cordial
respects and love may find acceptance with all my dear friends, and am,
reverend and dear Sir,

                              Ever yours,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXIII.


                            _To Mr. E――――._

                                          _Gloucester, Dec. 5, 1748._

_Dear Mr. E――――_,

WHY no letter from you all this while? I have written to you several
times. Lately I sent a case full of divers things for _Bethesda_. When
I return to _London_, I purpose to send more. I hear that my wife hath
lessened the family; but how it stands now, I cannot expect to know
for a certainty till I see her. I expect her daily, though I am apt to
believe she will not embark till she sees _Betty W――――_. I hope ere now
you have welcomed her to _Bethesda_ in the name of the LORD. I expect
to be over with you again by this time twelvemonth. In the mean while,
I trust we shall make some better advances towards heaven than we have
hitherto done, and be more conformed to the blessed and glorious JESUS.
Thanks be to his great name, he continues to deal bountifully with me.
I am pretty well in health, and hope to hear that you are so. I send
you all my blessing, and am

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXIV.


               _To the Honourable Trustees of Georgia._

                                          _Gloucester, Dec. 6, 1748._

_Honoured Gentlemen_,

NOT want of respect, but a suspicion that my letters would not be
acceptable, has been the occasion of my not writing to you these four
years last past. I am sensible, that in some of my former letters,
through hurry of business, want of more experience, and in all
probability too great an opinion of my own sufficiency, I expressed
myself in too strong, and sometimes unbecoming terms. For this I desire
to be humbled before GOD and man, knowing that, _Peter_-like, by a
misguided zeal, I have cut off as it were those ears which otherwise
might have been open to what I had to offer. However I can assure
you, honoured gentlemen, to the best of my knowledge, I have acted
a disinterested part, and notwithstanding my manifold mistakes and
imprudence, I have simply aimed at GOD’s glory and the good of mankind.
This principle drew me first to _Georgia_; this, and this alone,
induced me to begin and carry on the scheme of the _Orphan-house_; and
this, honoured gentlemen, excites me to trouble you with the present
lines. I need not inform you, honoured gentlemen, how the colony of
_Georgia_ has been declining for these many years last past, and at
what great disadvantages I have maintained a large family in that
wilderness, through the providence of a good and gracious GOD. Upwards
of five thousand pounds have been expended in that undertaking, and
yet very little proficiency made in the cultivation of my tract of
land, and that entirely owing to the necessity I lay under of making
use of white hands. Had a negroe been allowed, I should now have had
a sufficiency to support a great many orphans, without expending above
half the sum which hath been laid out. An unwillingness to let so
good a design drop, and having a rational conviction that it must
necessarily, if some other method was not fixed upon to prevent it.
These two considerations, honoured gentlemen, prevailed on me about
two years ago, through the bounty of my good friends, to purchase a
plantation in _South-Carolina_, where negroes are allowed. Blessed be
GOD, this plantation hath succeeded; and though at present I have only
eight working hands, yet in all probability there will be more raised
in one year, and with a quarter the expence, than has been produced at
_Bethesda_ for several years last past. This confirms me in the opinion
I have entertained for a long time, that _Georgia_ never can or will be
a flourishing province without negroes are allowed. But notwithstanding
my private judgment, I am determined that not one of mine shall ever be
allowed to work at the Orphan-House, till I can do it in a legal manner,
and by the approbation of the honourable trustees. My chief end in
writing this, is to inform you, honourable gentlemen, of the matter of
fact, and to let you know, that I am as willing as ever to do all I can
for _Georgia_ and the Orphan-house, if either a limited use of negroes
is approved of, or some more indented servants sent over. If not, I
cannot promise to keep any large family, or cultivate the plantation
in any considerable manner. My strength must necessarily be taken to
the other side. I would also further recommend it to your consideration,
honourable gentlemen, whether or not as the Orphan-house was and is
intended for a charitable purpose, it ought not to be exempted from
all quit-rents and public taxes, as I believe is customary universally
for such institutions to be? And as most of the land on which the
Orphan-house is built, is good for little, I would humbly enquire,
whether I may not have a grant for five hundred more acres that are
not taken up, somewhere near the Orphan-house? My intention is, if
you, honourable gentlemen, are pleased to put the colony upon another
footing, (I mean in respect to the permission of a limited use of
negroes) to make the Orphan-house not only a receptacle for fatherless
children, but also a place of literature and academical studies. Such
a place is much wanted in the southern parts of _America_; and if
conducted in a proper manner, must necessarily be of great service to
any colony. I can easily procure proper persons to embark in such a
cause, and I do not know but several families would go over, supposing
I could give them a probable prospect of a support upon their honest
industry, I could say more, but I fear I have been already too prolix.
I humbly recommend what has been urged to your consideration, and beg
leave to subscribe myself, honourable gentlemen,

                  Your most obedient humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCXV.


                      _To the Countess of H――――._

                                            _Bristol, Dec. 10, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

THOUGH I am afraid of taking too much freedom, yet the duty I owe to
your Ladyship constrains me to send you a few lines from hence. I came
hither last night, after having preached five times in _Gloucester_,
and once in _Gloucestershire_. The glorious _Emmanuel_ pleased to shine
upon my administrations, and many told me they received a blessing. The
bishop behaved respectfully when I was at sacrament at the cathedral,
and my old tutor, Dr. _R――――_, one of the prebendaries, was very
cordial when I waited upon him. I told him that my judgment (as I
trust) was a little more ripened than it was some years ago, and that
as fast as I found out my faults I would be glad to acknowledge them.
He said, as I grew moderate, the offence the Governors of the Church
had taken against me, would lessen and wear off. Blessed be GOD, I
am pretty easy about that: so that I can but act an honest part, and
be kept from trimming, I will, through the divine assistance, leave
all consequences to him who orders all things well. Thanks be to his
great name, a wonderous change is wrought on Mr. _L――――_. He came to
see and hear me at _Gloucester_: his worldly shackles are dropping off
apace, and his feet begin to be set in a large room. The news of his
conversion hath reached Mr. _W――――_, who wrote him a long letter; but
to send dissuasives to a man that hath seen and felt so much, is like
throwing chaff against a brass wall. He begged me to send his duty
to your Ladyship when I wrote, as does my brother, at whose house I
am. I trust he is coming forwards, and that he will at length fairly
shake hands with the world, and act as one alive to GOD. I think your
Ladyship meets with great encouragement. My continual prayer to the
blessed Redeemer in your Ladyship’s behalf is, “that your bow may abide
in strength, and the arms of your hands be strengthened by the hands of
the mighty GOD of _Jacob_.” He is the rock of ages. He is the LORD our
righteousness. In him is our strength found. Thanks be to the GOD and
Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, for shewing your Ladyship the way to
fetch continual strength and supplies from him! I could enlarge, but
am streightened in paper. If Mr. _C――――_ hath courage enough, I expect
to see him, and then I shall have it in my power to send your Ladyship
word how matters stand at _Bath_. In the mean while, I beg leave with
all dutiful respects to subscribe myself, honoured madam.

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXVI.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                            _Bristol, Dec. 12, 1748._

_My dear Tommy_,

THE love I bear to you, will not suffer me to omit answering your
letter the very first opportunity. I find you are in danger of being
led into temptation. If only your preparations for business keep you
from attending on the word preached, how will it be when you are
totally immersed in it? O my dear man, let that promise of our LORD’s
be written on the tables of your heart, “seek you first the kingdom
of GOD and his righteousness, and all those things shall be added
unto you.” If you act inconsistent with this, assure yourself your
endeavours will be blasted; and GOD out of love will curse your
temporal blessings. But enough of this. I hope a word to the wise is
sufficient.――Since I wrote thus far, I have received a letter from good
Lady _H――――n_, desiring I would come up to town. I therefore propose
to be with you, GOD willing, by _Saturday_ night, and to preach at the
Tabernacle next _Sunday_. Be pleased to apprize all friends of it. If
you are at the tabernacle-house on _Saturday_ evening, it would be very
agreeable to,

                      Yours, &c. in great haste,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXVII.


                         _To Mr. H―――― H――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 18, 1748._

I Can assure you, my not being able to write to you during my last
excursion, has given me much concern. I love to be punctual. Journeying,
preaching, and a train of business for the best of masters, has
prevented my being so now. I have been at _Gloucester_, in other parts
of _Gloucestershire_, and at _Bristol_, where I trust the sound of my
Redeemer’s feet was heard behind me. My brother I hope is coming on. I
like him better than I have for some years. He greatly regards you, and
intends answering your kind letters. I proposed his meeting you here.
What do you think of it? He likes it well. I wrote for him to come up
next week. I expect to know by _Wednesday_ or _Thursday_. If you could
be here on a LORD’s day, or a _Thursday_, you might see our assembly
at the other end of the town. I trust, abiding good will be done among
some at least of the rich and great. I thank you a thousand times for
your advice in respect to my health.――For near these two months past,
my usual reachings have left me. I find that keeping from too much
fatigue, under GOD, must be my cure. I will endeavour to keep within
bounds every way. I have shewed the doctor’s letter to Lady _H――――_,
but she is of opinion, the journals as now corrected ought to be
reprinted. In the multitude of councils there is safety; the language
of my heart is,

                _LORD, teach me when I go astray,_
                _And lead me in thy perfect way._

O that my zeal may increase with prudence. I have had too little of
both. I am now thirty-four years of age, and alas! how little have I
done and suffered for Him, who has done and suffered so much for me!
Thanks be to his great name, for countenancing my poor administrations
so much! I know not how it is, but perhaps it may be to display the
riches of free grace, that notwithstanding the first zeal of most,
I might add, all men of GOD, is generally mixed with much wildfire,
yet their first times have been generally blest most, especially
for awakening and converting souls. Blessed be our good GOD that
Mr. _H――――_ is coming out. May the LORD JESUS make him a spiritual
father to thousands! I smiled when you said, he would avoid the name
of _Methodist_, if he could. Alas, my dear man, he might as soon think
to wash a blackmoor white. The _Methodists_ are now as it were a skreen
for others. Formerly, if a person was serious, or preached CHRIST,
he was termed a _Puritan_, now he is a Methodist: But do you go on as
you are able to bear it. Opposition shall follow you; without it, be
as prudent as you will, your sincerity towards GOD and love for souls
cannot be evidenced. Self, love of praise, and love of the world, must
come down. Our LORD always does this, by way of sufferings inward or
outward, or rather by both. One Mr. _L――――_ of _Gloucestershire_, whom
Mr. _H――――_ knows, though he has begun to preach CHRIST but lately, yet
is already warned to leave his cure. Our LORD will provide for him. He
is a new creature indeed. I do not blame you for your conduct towards
Mrs. _D――――_. She is a good woman, and I believe thirsts for the
Redeemer’s glory. I wish she would not write so much. And what shall
I say more? I hope you have had enough from me now. My very dear Sir,
when am I to hear that you are a preacher of CHRIST crucified? I long
for the time, and earnestly pray that you may be freed from worldly
hopes and worldly fears: for till then, I cannot believe a man, let his
other accomplishments be ever so great, will be much owned and blessed
by the great head of the church. I should be glad to know what my Lord
of _Exeter_ said. I thank the LORD of all Lords for giving you so much
encouragement. Let this excite you to press forwards, and never fear
what man or devils say of, or can do unto you. Dear, very dear Sir, my
heart is enlarged towards you. I thank you, for remembering an unworthy
worm before him who is the great high-priest and blessed apostle of our
profession. As he enables, I shall return the favour, being, for his
great name’s sake, very dear Sir,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXVIII.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. H――――._

                                         _London, December 18, 1748._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

THOUGH I am not personally acquainted with you, yet I owe you much love.
Thanks be to our great high Priest for giving you such light and heat,
and enabling you to preach among poor sinners the unsearchable riches
of redeeming love. Earth and hell will be up in arms against you; your
own mother’s children will soon be angry with you, and many of the
members of that church of which you are a minister, whenever you preach
her doctrine with power and purity, will think it doing GOD’s service
to cast you out. Thus it has been, thus it will be in all ages, so long
as those two seeds of the woman and the serpent remain struggling in
this lower world. Welcome, welcome dear Sir, into the field of battle!
Now the common people will hear you gladly. Now the self-righteous
will speak all manner of evil against you. I am told the corporation
have rejected you for preaching CHRIST crucified. I wish you joy. May
you, like blessed _Paul_, increase the more in strength, and be made
a spiritual father to thousands! Excuse this freedom from one who
loves you in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST. I thank you for your intended
interview. Could no way be contrived for a private visit? however
that be, assure yourself your interest will be much upon my heart,
and if you will remember a poor unworthy worm before his throne, whose
compassions fail not, you will much oblige, reverend and dear Sir,

             Your most affectionate brother and servant in
                             JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXIX.


                          _To Doctor D――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 21, 1748._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

GLAD was I, yea very glad to receive your letter dated _November_
7th, though it did not reach me till last night. I thank you for it a
thousand times. It has led me to the throne of grace, where I have been
crying, “LORD, counsel my counsellors, and shew them what thou wouldst
have me to do.”――Alas, alas! how can I be too severe against myself,
who, _Peter_ like, have cut off so many ears, and by imprudencies mixed
with my zeal, have dishonoured the cause of JESUS? I can only look up
to him, who healed the high-priest’s servant’s ear, and say, “LORD,
heal all the wounds my misguided zeal has given.” Assure yourself,
dear Sir, everything I print shall be revised. I always have submitted
my poor performances to my friends corrections. Time and experience
I find ripen men’s judgments, and make them more solid, rational, and
consistent, both in their conduct and writings. O that this may be
my case! O that the blessed JESUS may enable me to hold on, and hold
out, and keep me from flagging in the latter stages of my road. I thank
you, dear Sir, for your solemn charge in respect to my health. Blessed
be GOD, it is much repaired since my return from _Scotland_, and I
trust by observing the rules you prescribe (if I must live) I shall
be enabled to declare the works of the LORD. But what shall I say
concerning your present trial? shall I wish you joy? Surely I may with
great propriety, since an inspired writer hath said, “count it all joy
when you fall into divers temptations.” But at the same time, reverend
Sir, I most earnestly sympathize with you, having had the same trial
from the same quarter long ago. The _Moravians_ first divided my family,
then my parish at _Georgia_, and after that the societies which, under
GOD, I was an instrument of gathering. I suppose not less than four
hundred, through their practices, have left the tabernacle. But I have
been forsaken otherways. I have not had above an hundred to hear me,
where I had twenty thousand, and hundreds now assemble within a quarter
of a mile of me, who never come to see or speak to me; though they must
own at the great day that I was their spiritual father. All this I
find but little enough to teach me to cease from man, and to wean me
from that too great fondness which spiritual fathers are apt to have
for their spiritual children. Thus blessed _Paul_ was served, thus must
all expect to be treated who are of _Paul_’s spirit, and are honoured
with any considerable degree of _Paul_’s success. But I have generally
observed, that when one door of usefulness is shut, another opens.
Our LORD blesses you, dear Sir, in your writings; nay your people’s
treating you as they are now permitted to do, perhaps is one of the
greatest blessings you ever received from heaven. May patience have its
perfect work, and may you be enabled to sanctify the LORD GOD in your
heart! I know of no other way of dealing with the _M――――s_, than to go
on preaching the truth as it is in JESUS, and rest upon that promise,
“Every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be plucked
up.” Seven years will make a great alteration. I believe their grand
design is to extend their occonomy as far as possible. This I believe
is now kept up by dint of money, and I am apt to think that the very
thing by which they think to establish, will destroy their scheme.
_John Lapidee_ went on in the same manner in _Maryland_. His plan was
raised as high, and fell as remarkably. GOD is a gracious Father, and
will not always let his children proceed in a wrong way. Doubtless
there are many of his dear little ones in the _M――――n_ flock; but many
of their principles and practices are exceeding wrong, for which I
doubt not our LORD will rebuke them in his own time. But I fear that
I weary you. However, dear Sir, I must thank you for your sermon. It
contains the very life of preaching, I mean sweet invitations to close
with CHRIST. I do not wonder you are dubbed a Methodist on account of
it. As it was designed for the poor, I wish it was cheaper. I think
practical books cannot be too reasonable. The poor must have them cheap,
and the rich will like them the better for it. And now methinks I hear
you say, “But how is it at the other end of the town?” Blessed be GOD,
the prospect is promising. Last _Sunday_ evening I preached to a most
brilliant assembly indeed. They expressed great approbation, and some I
think begin to feel. Good Lady _H――――n_ is indeed a mother in _Israel_.
She is all in a flame for JESUS. You may guess by a word or two in this,
that she hath shewn me your last letter. I suppose she will write to
you soon. But whither am I running? I quite forget myself. Love makes
my pen to move too fast, and too long. Excuse it, dear Sir, and for
JESUS’s sake never cease praying for, Reverend and very dear Sir,

        Your most affectionate though unworthy younger brother,
                and willing servant in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCXX.


                           _Dear Mr. T――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 21, 1748._

HAVE you not thought it unkind, that I answered not your letter before
now. You will be pacified when I tell you, that not want of love but
leisure hath been the cause of so long a silence. I will now redeem a
few moments to pay this debt, and acknowledge a much greater debt of
love that I owe, and intend indeed to be always owing to you and yours.
CHRIST alone can pay you. He will. Whatever is done to his ministers,
he looks upon as done to himself. What a blessed master do we serve!
Thanks be to his great name, he continues to deal lovingly with me. I
have been blessed in my late excursion into the country, and likewise
since I came to town. The prospect of doing good at least to some
of the rich, is very encouraging. I know you will pray, that the
foolishness of preaching may be a means of bringing some of them to
believe on him who justifies the ungodly. You find, that not gifts but
grace, sovereign, all powerful grace alone, can reach the heart. But
how is dear Mr. _B――――_? Is he yet fled to the world of spirits? Since
the LORD has been pleased to hinder his preaching, I think it was cruel
to desire he should stay any longer out of heaven. Doctor _Watts_ is
now gone. Blessed be GOD we shall ere long follow

              _Where sin and pain and sorrow cease,_
              _And all is love and joy and peace._

I am now thirty four years of age. Little did I think of living so long.
And yet when I consider how I have lived, shame and confusion cover
my face. O my dear Mr. _T――――_, as you are preparing for the ministry,
lose not one moment of time, but labour to be always on the stretch for
Him, who was stretched on the accursed cross for you. Study books and
men, but above all, study your own heart and the knowledge of JESUS
CHRIST, and him crucified. Get your heart free from worldly hopes and
worldly fears, and you will avoid thousands of those snares, into which
young ministers for want of this too often fall. O let the language of
your heart be, “GOD forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of
CHRIST, by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.”
You will excuse this freedom. It proceeds from the love I bear you. Be
pleased to present my cordial respects to your honoured father, your
brother, and all enquiring friends, and accept of the same yourself in
the most tender manner, from, my dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXXI.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 26, 1748._

_My dear Brother_,

AS soon as I received your kind letter, I was willing, but till now
could not get leisure, to answer it. Accept my thanks, though late, and
let the glorious _Emmanuel_ have eternal thanks ascribed unto him, if
he has been pleased to work upon your soul by any of my poor writings.
Since that, I doubt not but you have experienced much of his love, and
know more of GOD, even a GOD in CHRIST, and also of your own heart. In
these two things consist all our happiness in time and for eternity.
Blessed be his name for calling you to witness the efficacy of his
death, and the unsearchable riches of his grace to poor sinners. My
dear brother, it is an angelic employ. Go on in the name and strength
of JESUS. He will not send you a warfare on your own charges. As your
day is so shall your strength be. Only wait upon him, and eternal truth
has declared, that you shall mount on wings like an eagle, you shall
walk and not be weary, nay run and not be faint. Should providence
bring me your way in the Spring, I shall rejoice to see and converse
with you, and shall tell all that come in my way, of the present as
well as future great salvation that is to be had in JESUS CHRIST. In
the mean while, I entreat you to pray for me, and as enabled you shall
be remembered by, my dear Brother,

       Your affectionate brother and servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXXII.


                           _To Lord B――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 30, 1748._

_My Lord_,

I Had the honour of your Lordship’s letter. Gratitude constrains me to
send my heartiest acknowledgments. Though absent from, yet I am often
present with you. That benign, that sweet disposition of which your
Lordship is possessed, must make you appear amiable to all who know
you. Add but the christian to it, and then, O then, how happy will your
Lordship be! Thanks be to GOD, that your Lordship begins to feel there
is no being happy without real christianity. O that this conviction may
be abiding, and that your Lordship may have no rest, till you find it
in Him who is the Alpha and Omega, the author and finisher of our faith.
He longs to make you happy, he is ready to receive you with open arms.
He cries, “My Son, give me thy heart.” To engage you to love him more,
he has let you have a worthy lady, who I am persuaded will be glad
to go hand in hand to heaven. O that you may both walk in all the
ordinances and commandments of the LORD blameless. No greater thing
can be desired for you at the throne of grace by, my Lord,

        Your Lordship’s most obedient, obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXXIII.


                           _To Lady B――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 30, 1748._

_Honoured Madam_,

HAVE you not wondered at my not answering your Ladyship’s kind letter
before now? But I am persuaded you are well assured, that a variety of
avocations, and multiplicity of business for the best of masters, not
want of respect, hath been the cause. My Lady, your family are always
upon my heart. My constant desire and prayer to GOD is, that you all
may be filled with all the fulness of GOD. As my Lord mentions nothing
to the contrary, I hope your indisposition is removed, and that the
language of your heart is, “what shall I render unto the LORD?” I know
that the love of JESUS which you have felt, must necessarily constrain
your Ladyship to live to Him, who lived and died upon the accursed tree
for you. O how is the power of the Redeemer’s resurrection displayed in
Lady _H――――n_. She is a mother in _Israel_ indeed. It would please you
to see the assemblies at her Ladyship’s house. They are brilliant ones
indeed. The prospect of catching some of the rich in the gospel net is
very promising. I know you will wish prosperity in the name of the LORD.
But how does good Lady _D――――_, dear Mrs. _C――――_, and Mrs. _I――――_?
All, I hope, putting off the old man, and putting on the new with
greater earnestness than ever. O that I may begin to be in earnest!
I am now thirty-four years of age. Is it not time for me to begin to
spend, and be spent, for him who has loved me and given himself for
me? I beg your Ladyship’s prayers, and the prayers of all your dear and
honoured relations. I send them all my humble and hearty respects, and
beg you will accept the same from, my Lady,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXXIV.


                         _To Mr. H―――― H――――._

                                            _Chelsea, Jan. 12, 1749._

_My dear Brother_,

I Can now send you but a few lines. Thanks be to GOD, that weeping
doth not hinder sowing. I think it is cruel to wish our little ones
back into this cold world again. Go on, JESUS will be better to you
and yours than seven daughters. I hope Mrs. _H――――_ joins with you in
saying, “it is well.” But a word or two in answer to the other part
of your letter. Cannot you be at _Gloucester_ the 24th of this month?
That would be abundantly more convenient for me than the 27th. I would
appoint our _English_ meeting at that time, and, GOD willing, would
go with you to _Builth_, and after that to the west. I am now here
waiting for Lord _B――――ke_, and some others, who are coming to hear
the glorious gospel. Lord _L――――_ is in town. Our good Lady is going
on, and every day increasing her reward in heaven. I have much to say
when we meet. When will you leave off being a spiritual rake? For the
present, adieu! Pray fail not being at _Gloucester_. In the mean while,
let us ply the throne of grace in behalf of each other, and do you pray
that an humble, child-like, obedient heart, may be given to, my very
dear fellow-soldier,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXXV.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. H――――._

                                            _Chelsea, Jan. 13, 1749._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

YOUR kind and loving answer to my last poor scrawl, humbled me much
before Him who alone worketh all things in and by us. But if he will
work, who shall hinder? I trust the language of my heart to the
ever-blessed JESUS is this,

                _If thou excuse then work thy will,_
                _By so unfit an instrument;_
                _It will at once thy goodness shew,_
                _And prove thy power omnipotent._

You will not be offended if I tell you, that good Lady _H――――n_ saw
your letter. She was much pleased with it, and has a great regard for
you. She goes on from strength to strength. The prospect of doing good
to the rich that attend her Ladyship’s house, is very encouraging.
I preach twice a week, and yesterday Lord _B――――ke_ was one of my
auditors. His Lordship was pleased to express very great satisfaction.
Who knows what GOD may do? He can never work by a meaner instrument.
O dear Sir, pray for me. I want humility, I want thankfulness, I want
a heart continually flaming with the love of GOD. Blessed be his name
for the share imparted to you. May you go on and increase with all the
increase of GOD! I thank you for your kind invitation to your house and
pulpit. I would not bring you or any of my friends into difficulties,
for owning poor, unworthy, ill and hell deserving me. But if providence
should give me a clear call, I should be glad to come your way. I
rejoice in the prospect of having some ministers in our church pulpits
that dare own a crucified Redeemer. I hope the time will come that
many of the priests also shall be obedient to the word, and that of the
honourable women there will be not a few. I know you will say _Amen_.
For the present, my dear Sir, adieu. Remember me to the doctor, and
Mr. _H――――_, when you write to or see them, and assure yourself of a
constant remembrance in the poor but sincere petitions of, very dear
Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in the best bonds,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXXVI.


                            _To Dr. S――――._

                                             _London, Jan. 17, 1749._

_Very dear Sir_,

I Received your last kind letter, soon after I had been informing dear
Mr. _H――――_ that I did not chuse to bring my friends into trouble; but
that if providence should give me a clear call, I might accept of his
invitation. This perhaps may never happen. But if it should, wherefore
should dear Mr. _S――――_ be so much alarmed? What if his people are
prejudiced against me? Might not a sermon, under GOD, lessen their
prejudices, and perhaps awaken some souls to a sense of the divine
life? Such things have been done, such a thing, through the divine
blessing, may be repeated again. The way of duty is the way of safety.
Our LORD requires of us to confess him in his gospel members and
ministers. To be afraid of professing the one, or publicly to own,
associate with, and strengthen the hands and hearts of the other,
especially when they are set for the defence of the gospel, is, in my
opinion, very offensive in the sight of our common LORD, and can only
proceed from a want of more love to him and his dear people. I am quite
of your mind, my dear friend, that our LORD recommends to us the wisdom
of the serpent, but then it is always to be blended with the innocence
of the dove. How this is done, in effect, by disowning the open and
avowed proclaimers of his eternal truths, I cannot I must confess
at present see into. You say, “we are most of us too warm already:”
but I hope you do not think, that being ashamed of any of your LORD’s
ministers is an instance of it? Thanks be to GOD that Mr. _H――――_ seems,
as you express it, “to court the enmity of mankind;” it is an error
of the right side. Better so than to be afraid of it. The LORD never
threatned to spew any church out of his mouth for being too hot; but
for being neither hot nor cold he has. It is too true, my dear Sir,
“we have but few faithful ministers.” But is keeping at a distance from
one another the way to strengthen their interest? By no means. I rather
think those that hold the same principles at least, and are embarked
in the same cause, should jointly and publicly appear for GOD.――And to
tell you my whole mind, I do not believe GOD will bless either you or
your friends to any considerable degree, till you are more delivered
from the fear of man. Alas, how was you bowed down with it, when I saw
you last! And your letter bespeaks you a slave to it yet. O my brother,
deal faithfully with yourself, and you will find a love of the world,
and fear of not providing for your children, have gotten too much hold
of your heart. Do not mistake me. I would not have you throw yourself
into flames. I would only have you act a consistent part, and not for
fear of a little contempt be ashamed of owning the ministers of CHRIST.
After all, think not, my dear Sir, that I am pleading my own cause. You
are not in danger of seeing me at _N――――n_. I only take this occasion
of saying a word or two to your heart. You will not be offended, as it
proceeds from love. You may shew this to dear Mr. _H――――_. I salute him,
the dear doctor, and dear Mr. _H――――_, most cordially. I hope the seed
is sown among the rich to some purpose. Last _Thursday_ Lord _B――――ke_
was one of my hearers. Brethren pray for us; you are never forgotten by,
very dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXXVII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                             _London, Jan. 18, 1749._

_My very dear Mr. S――――_,

I Have received from you two very kind letters, the last of which
made me to smile indeed. Alas, my dear man, what airy castles are you
building? Were your sanguine expectations to take place, might I not
justly say to my friends, “_Quid vultis, ut peream_?” But blessed be
GOD, there is yet no danger. The gospel is not got so near the court
as you imagine. However, some of the mighty and noble come twice a week
to hear at good Lady _H――――n_’s, and the prospect of doing good amongst
them is very encouraging. One or two I trust are effectually touched.
Pray on, and who knows what a great fire a little spark may kindle?
I wish the LORD may answer your request, and give you a religious
governor. I cannot see how I can serve dear Mr. _B――――_. I should be
very shy of asking any favours, supposing I had interest, lest I should
be thought to preach for myself and not for CHRIST JESUS my LORD. I
would fain convince all, that I seek not theirs but them. I am sorry
you have met with so many losses of late; but all our losses will be
found to be gain in the end. Blessed are they that love GOD! All things
are even now working together for their good. About _August_ I purpose,
GOD willing, to embark for _Carolina_; though my friends say not, I
believe they will be mistaken. Ere this reaches you, I hope GOD will
have raised you up Pastors after his own heart. Pray remember me in
the most endearing manner to all that I was acquainted with, and tell
them I live in hopes of seeing them once more in the flesh. I heartily
salute all, and am, very dear Mr. _S――――_,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXXVIII.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                            _Bristol, Jan. 28, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Think it is now high time for me to trouble your Ladyship with a
few lines. They come to thank your Ladyship ten thousand times for
all favours, and to inform you that our glorious Redeemer orders all
things well. On _Wednesday_, through winds, rain and frost, I reached
_Gloucester_, and preached there the same evening. The next day we held
out association, and, thanks be to GOD, affairs turned out better than
expectation. I came hither this evening, where I found my brother in
the very temper I could wish, “seemingly quite fixed to leave the world
for GOD.” He tells me of a Colonel, who heard me once in the Summer,
that now wants to know if his sins are forgiven. My brother’s visit to
town has been greatly blessed to him. Surely your Ladyship will never
know, till the day of judgment, the great ends GOD had in view in
calling your Ladyship to _London_. I rejoice in the prospect of seeing
your Ladyship happy amidst a crowd of your spiritual children, who
will come to you from time to time to be built up in their most holy
faith. You will suffer many pangs for them; but all shall work for your
Ladyship’s present and eternal good. I suffer much in my bodily health
for preaching to the nobility; but, thanks be to GOD, that some seem to
have an hearing ear, and an understanding heart. My warmest prayers are
continually ascending to the throne of grace for your Ladyship, and for
all those who have heard the word, especially those honourable women
that used to join with your Ladyship in receiving the sacred symbols
of the Redeemer’s blessed body and blood. My cry to our LORD in their
behalf is this,

              _Take their poor hearts, and let them be_
              _For ever clos’d to all but thee._

I forgot to tell your Ladyship, that the _Welch_ justices have ordered
the twenty pounds, exacted of the Methodists by Sir _W――――_, to be
returned. I can add up more, but my most grateful acknowledgments for
all kindnesses, and subscribe myself, honoured Madam,

         Your Ladyship’s most dutiful and willing servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXXIX.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                             _Bristol, Feb. 1, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

YESTERDAY I had the favour of your Ladyship’s letter; and am glad to
find that Lady _G――――_’s journey will not be altogether in vain. Our
LORD will note, in his book, your Ladyship’s endeavour to serve her,
and reward you openly before men and angels, for this and all other
your works of faith, and labours of love. I am glad your Ladyship
approves of Mr. _W――――_’s conduct, and that he hath preached at your
Ladyship’s. The language of my heart is, “LORD, send by whom thou wilt
send, only convert some of the mighty and noble, for thy mercy’s sake!
Then I care not if I am heard of no more.” I am much obliged to those
honourable ladies who are pleased to send me their good wishes. In
return, they have my earnest prayers that they may be filled with all
the fulness of GOD. For my own part, I long to take the field. I trust
we shall see a glorious Spring, and hear of many souls crying out,
“What shall we do to be saved?” Blessed be GOD, we have solid seasons
here. I trust I can with truth say, “The gospel has been preached with
the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.” Next _Monday_, GOD willing, I
shall travel further _Westward_. In the mean while, I purpose to preach
here, and at _Kingswood_, and to take a step to _Bath_. Mr. _C――――_
was here yesterday, and brought me a benefaction from Miss _S――――_,
of fifteen guineas, most or all of which I purpose paying to Mr. ――――,
towards discharging what is due to him for the Orphan-house. Thus
doth the LORD help me, who long ago deserved to be banished from his
presence for ever, and to be employed in his work no more. I am glad
your Ladyship approves of Mr. _G――――_: He is, I think, a worthy man.
By taking this method, your Ladyship will have an opportunity of
conversing with the best of all parties, without being a bigot, and too
strenuously attached to any. Surely in this your Ladyship is directed
from above. The blessed JESUS cares for his people of all denominations.
He is gathering his elect out of all. Happy they, who, with a
disinterested view, take in the whole church militant, and, in spite of
narrow-hearted bigots, breathe an undissembled catholic spirit towards
all. That your Ladyship may increase and grow in this spirit, and
consequently increase in true divine happiness every day, is and shall
be the constant prayer of, Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most obliged, obedient humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXXX.


                      _To the Countess of D――――._

                                             _Bristol, Feb. 1, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

WILL your Ladyship pardon me, if I inform you, that love and gratitude
constrain me to send your Ladyship a few lines? As I am daily praying
for the temporal and eternal welfare of your Ladyship, and your
honourable sister, so I cannot help informing you, that I trust you
have both such a view of the present great salvation, purchased for the
very chief of sinners by the blood of CHRIST, that you will neither of
you be at rest, till made real partakers thereof. Has not your Ladyship
already had a taste of this inward happiness? Assuredly you have.
Should not this encourage your Ladyship to expect, seek after, and
pray for unspeakably more? Undoubtedly it ought. The fulness which is
in JESUS is inexhaustible. Out of that fulness your Ladyship may be
always receiving grace for grace. Thanks be to GOD for teaching you the
way! Let not your honoured sister think herself too unworthy of such
a mercy. JESUS is worthy; she hath nothing to do but to bring all her
unworthiness to the LORD our righteousness, and accept of compleat
salvation as a free gift. Hearing, when last in town, that your
Ladyship would not be offended if I wrote, encouraged me to take
the liberty of troubling your Ladyship with this. As the glorious
_Emmanuel_ enables, it shall be followed with my most fervent prayers,
which have been, are, and, through JESUS CHRIST strengthening, shall
always be put up in behalf of yourself, and your honourable sister, by,
honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most obliged, obedient humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXXXI.


                            _To Mr. ――――._

                                             _Bristol, Feb. 4, 1749._

_My dear Sir_,

THE contents of your letter surprized me; and yet it is time for me to
learn to be surprized at nothing. But what shall we say? It must needs
be that these trials should come, to wean us from every creature, and
teach us to live by faith in the Son of GOD. Had you succeeded, you
certainly would have met with some thorn in the flesh, to keep you from
being elated too much. Persons of such sanguine dispositions as you and
I are, always need one from some quarter or another. By your letter,
this trial has done you good already. Be thankful for it, therefore,
my dear Sir, and say from your inmost soul, “the cup, which my heavenly
Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?”――We are but poor choosers
for ourselves. GOD sees not as we see. It is a comfort when we can
say, we have eyed GOD in any affair; but if that affair be plainly
disconcerted by his providence, we may be certain it is for good. I
found it so in a like circumstance, when my affections were much more
engaged than yours necessarily must have been. I wish you joy of being
called to leave a worm for GOD, and in your submission to his divine
appointment. “Surely,” (says the prophet that was sent to anoint one of
_Jesse_’s sons) “the LORD’s anointed is before me.” He guessed several
times; but always guessed wrong, till little _David_ was sent for, who
was thought nothing of. And if a prophet was mistaken, when thus sent
in a peculiar manner, and no doubt particularly engaged in prayer for
direction, is it any wonder, that we should find ourselves mistaken in
many things, even when we have been most earnest with GOD for guidance
and direction? GOD often guides us by disappointments; and I doubt not
but you will find some better thing is prepared for you. What the LORD
hath done to you, though you know not now, yet you shall know hereafter.

                                I.

              _Leave to his sovereign sway_
                _To choose and to command;_
              _So shalt thou wond’ring own his way,_
                _How wise, how strong his hand._

                                II.

              _Far, far above thy thoughts,_
                _His counsel shall appear,_
              _When fully he the work hath wrought,_
                _Which caus’d thy needless fear._

You see, dear Sir, my concern for you by the length of this letter. As
you are, I trust, my own son in the faith, so I cannot avoid naturally
caring for you. My letter shall be followed with my prayers. Be
resigned. I am better in health than when I left town; and am much
blessed in preaching. You know how to give thanks in behalf of

                       Your sympathizing friend,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXXXII.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                                _Exon, Feb. 9, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship’s laying your commands upon me to write often, makes
me uneasy unless I can redeem time to send to your Ladyship at least
once a week. Blessed be GOD, I can inform your Ladyship, that there
was a great stirring among the dry bones at _Bristol_ and _Kingswood_.
Last Lord’s-day was a great day of the Son of Man. The power of the
LORD attended the word, as in days of old, and several persons, that
had never heard me before, were brought under great awakenings. A
counsellor came once, and was so affected, that when he got home he
invited others to come and hear, which so alarmed his lady, (ready
to die of a consumption) that she is afraid her husband will go mad.
Last night I came hither, and had the pleasure of seeing some spiritual
children that were begotten unto GOD when I was here last. This evening
I am to begin to spread the gospel-net; and shall continue in _Exeter_
till _Monday_. Affairs have been so confused, that it requires some
time to settle them. I find a death must come upon all we do, that the
life of it may appear to be wholly of GOD. I hope your Ladyship finds
that the Redeemer’s work flourishes in your hands. I long to hear,
whether my letters were kindly received, and whether the seed sown by
me or any other springs up. Whoever plants, or whoever waters, I know
it is the LORD must give the increase. Mr. _C――――_ is vastly attached
to your Ladyship’s interest, and, I believe, prays continually for
your success. Many do so, whom your Ladyship knows not. Your Ladyship’s
letter to Mr. _R――――_ I find is blessed much. It is the good man’s lot,
that whatsoever he doth shall prosper. May this be fulfilled in your
Ladyship more and more every day! I could enlarge, but must away to
my delightful work. People are waiting. This late journey has been
blessed to the recovery of my health. I have not had any of my usual
disorders since I left town. I am sometimes faint. But, “Faint, and
yet pursuing,” must be the christian’s motto. I hope my most dutiful
respects will find acceptance with those honourable persons whose faces
are set _Zion-wards_, and that your Ladyship will accept the same from,
honoured Madam,

          Your Ladyship’s most obliged, obedient, and willing
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXXXIII.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                           _Plymouth, Feb. 16, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

THE last time I wrote to your Ladyship, I was at _Exeter_, where I
begun on _Sunday_ evening to preach in the open air.――Abundance of
souls attended, and I trust real good was done. In the morning, grace
flowed richly round the congregation; and many knew experimentally that
CHRIST was risen, by his giving them to experience the power of his
resurrection in their hearts. On _Monday_ I went to _Bovey-Tracey_,
about 12 miles from _Exeter_, where I found several poor simple souls.
Here also the fountain of life was open, and I believe some drank at,
and others felt the want of it. The next morning I preached at a place
called _Mary-Church_, where are supposed to be near a score of awakened
souls, who have undergone much outward trouble for adhering to the
cross of CHRIST. Most of their bitterest opposers were present. All
was calm; and the power of the LORD accompanied the word. After sermon
I rode twenty miles to _Kingsbridge_, where, to my great surprize, I
found about a thousand souls waiting till eight in the evening to hear
the word. Though nature said, “Spare thyself,” I thought faith and duty
said, “Venture upon the LORD’s strength, and speak to them.” I did,
from these words of our dear LORD’s: “I must work the works of him that
sent me, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work.” I
preached in the street. The moon-shone. All was quiet; and I hope some
begun to think of working out their salvation with fear and trembling.
The next morning I preached there again; four ministers attended. Our
LORD was pleased to make it a very fine season. After sermon I had the
pleasure of hearing, that by two or three discourses preached at this
place about 5 years ago, many souls were awakened. One young man, then
called, is since a preacher; he was in a tree partly to ridicule me. I
spoke to him to imitate _Zaccheus_, and come down and receive the LORD
JESUS. The word was backed with power――He heard, came down, believed,
and now adorns the gospel. From _Kingsbridge_ to _Plymouth_, is near
twenty post miles. Hither I came last night. About ten miles from the
town, I met several of my spiritual children, who came on horseback to
see me. When I came into the town, many hundreds were waiting to hear
the word, and received me with great joy. Though it was past seven at
night, and I had preached at _Kingsbridge_ in the morning, I thought
it my duty to comply with the people’s importunity, and accordingly I
called upon them, (in a place stiled the tabernacle, built since I have
been absent) to behold the Lamb of GOD. I find a strange alteration in
the people since I came first here, now above four years ago. Many were
then awakened, and truly converted to the blessed JESUS. I write in a
house belonging to a married couple, who call me their spiritual father.
_Plymouth_ seems to be quite a new place to me. I have also just now
parted from a truly converted neighbouring clergyman, who has invited
me to preach in his church. Ere long I hope to send your Ladyship some
more good news. In the mean while, I wish your Ladyship the best of
blessings; and entreat your Ladyship to pray, that a chearful, humble,
simple, and guileless heart may be given to, honoured Madam,

         Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, though unworthy servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

I Had the pleasure of receiving your letters dated _December_ 29th and
31st. I thank you a thousand times for this, and all your other favours.
I did not think Mr. _H――――_’s friendship would hold long. It will be
time enough for me to speak to and of him, when I see _Bermudas_ again,
which I propose doing, GOD willing, as soon as possible. In the mean
while, I would only observe, that if I am a _Roman Catholic_, the
Pope must have given ♥me a very large dispensation. Surely Mr. _H――――_
has acted like one, to pretend so much friendship, and express it in
the strongest terms, and yet have nothing of it in his heart all the
while. But thus it must be. Dear Sir, we must be tried every way. _Hic
murus aheneus esto_, &c. As for any secrets that I told him, he is
very welcome to reveal them. You know me too well to judge I have many
secrets. May the secret of the LORD be with me! and then I care not if
there was a window in my heart for all mankind to see the uprightness
of my intentions. I long to have _Bethesda_ a foundation for the LORD
JESUS. If I can procure a proper solid person of good literature, who
will be content to stay two or three years, something may be done. I am
now in the _West_, and have begun to take the field. Great multitudes
flock to hear; and our LORD is pleased apparently to countenance my
poor unworthy ministrations. I have the pleasure of seeing the seed,
which was sown just before I embarked last for _America_, spring up,
producing an hundred-fold. May JESUS have all the glory! Perhaps (O
amazing love!) he has not done with me yet. I am better in bodily
health than usual, but expect to be sick again when I return to
_London_. Thither I must go in about a fortnight, to preach again to
some of the Rich and Great, as well as the Poor. I find it is a trial,
to be thus divided between the work on this and the other side of the
water. I am convinced I have done right in coming over now; and I keep
myself quite disengaged, that I may be free to leave _England_ the
latter end of the Summer, if our LORD is pleased to make my way clear.
I hope, as you say nothing to the ♦contrary, that all friends are well.
I beg to be remembered to them all in the kindest manner, and depend
much on their not forgetting to pray for, reverend and dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                           _To Lady H――――._

                                           _Plymouth, Feb. 21, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Believe it will much rejoice your Ladyship’s heart to hear what is
doing in the _West_. I could not have thought that the seed sown four
years ago, would have met with such a great increase. But what cannot
GOD do? I have now proclaimed here seven times the riches of redeeming
love, to very large, attentive, and affected auditories. Generally
about two thousand attend every night; and the _Sunday_ evening, in the
field, I believe there were above five thousand hearers. On _Wednesday_,
GOD willing, I move hence. My short stay affects the people. But our
LORD orders all things well. I hope to be in town at my appointed time,
at least within a few days of it. If Mr. _B――――_ is not returned, I
shall be grieved to think how your Ladyship will want the ordinance;
but, thanks be to GOD, the fountain is open, and your Ladyship knows
the way to it. Last Lord’s-day I administered the sacrament to some
few souls that had no pastor; and I could have wished your Ladyship
present to have seen an affecting sight,――two parents, both believers,
presenting two daughters and a son, in the most solemn manner, for the
first time to be communicants. I received them with all joy; and our
LORD graced the feast with much of his divine presence. Indeed, my good
Lady, affairs bear a very promising aspect. I hear that much good has
been done at _Bristol_. Every where fresh doors are opening, and people
flock from all quarters. Prejudices, I find, do subside, and, through
grace, strong impressions are made on many souls. I have not been so
well, for so long a season together, for many years, as I have been
since I left town. A proof, I think, that the LORD calls me into the
fields. I hear how your Ladyship has been, by the B――――p. Alas! how
does the enmity of the heart sometimes make persons to forget good
manners! Your Ladyship has been taught of GOD to forgive and pity. Well,
if the great shepherd and bishop of souls has work to be done, he will
raise up instruments, and find ways to send them out.

                                I.

              _Thoughts are vain against the LORD,_
              _All subserve his powerful word;_
              _Wheels encircling wheels must run,_
              _Each in course to bring it on._

                                II.

              _Blest is faith, that trusts his power,_
              _Blest are saints that wait his hour;_
              _Haste, great conqueror, bring it near,_
              _Let the glorious close appear._

I know that your Ladyship will say heartily, _Amen_. I doubt not but
your Ladyship enjoys much of his presence, which is better than life.
I hope your honourable and right honourable visitants share richly
with you. I beg leave to send them, and your Ladyship, my most dutiful
respects, and subscribe myself, honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, though unworthy servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXXXVI.


                           _To Lady G――――._

                                           _Plymouth, Feb. 22, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship’s letter I received yesterday; I trust under some sense
of the honour your Ladyship has done me, through the King of kings
making me instrumental in quickening or building up your Ladyship’s
precious and immortal soul. Like a pure chrystal, I would transmit all
the glory he is pleased to pour upon me, and never claim as my own,
what is his sole propriety. Thanks be to his great and glorious name,
for putting it into your Ladyship’s heart to say sincerely, “LORD,
increase my faith.” When I had read your Ladyship’s letter, I could not
help observing what a connection there was between the present frame
of your Ladyship’s heart, and your present circumstances in respect
to your servant. For how is it, honoured Madam, that our faith is
to be increased, but by our being exercised with trials? By these the
christian grows; and faith, like the burning bush amidst the furnace of
affliction, flourishes unconsumed. Blessed be GOD, that your Ladyship
hath taken hold of a great and precious promise. Our LORD has promised,
“that he will not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able to
bear.” And he is faithful that hath promised. We have nothing to do,
but to plead his promise in prayer. Be pleased, therefore, honoured
Madam, to solace yourself, under your present distress, with these
lines:

                                I.

              _With joy we meditate the grace_
                _Of our High-priest above;_
              _His heart is made of tenderness,_
                _His bowels melt with love._

                                II.

              _Touch’d with a sympathy within,_
                _He knows our feeble frame;_
              _He knows what sore temptations mean,_
                _For he has felt the same._

                                III.

              _He, in the days of feeble flesh,_
                _Pour’d out his cries and tears;_
              _And in his measure feels afresh,_
                _What every member bears._

                                IV.

              _Then let our humble faith address_
                _His mercy and his power;_
              _We shall obtain delivering grace,_
                _In the distressing hour._

This is, and shall be, honoured Madam, my daily prayer on your behalf.
Fear not; our LORD will take care that all shall work for good. Those
who are sincere, will soon get over such stumbling blocks; and those
that are not, will stumble at any thing, nay every thing. I bless GOD,
that some have got their faces set _Zion-wards_. Of the honourable
women, ere long, I trust, there will be not a few who will dare to be
singularly good, and confess the blessed JESUS before men. O with what
a holy contempt may the poor despised believer look down on those,
who are yet immersed in the pleasures of sense, and amidst all the
refinements of their unassisted, unenlightened reason, continue slaves
to their own lusts and passions. Happy, thrice happy they! who begin
to feel and experience what it is to be redeemed from this present
evil world. Well may they count all things but dung and dross for the
excellency of the knowledge of CHRIST JESUS their Lord. Well may they
look upon the few righteous, as the only truly excellent ones of the
earth; and choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of GOD,
than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. You, honoured Madam, I
trust, are one of this happy number. May all your children add to it,
and follow your Ladyship, as they see you follow CHRIST. I hope that
some have been inclined to list under his banner, since I left town.
Indeed the glorious Redeemer has dealt bountifully with his people,
and with unworthy me. The good Lady _H――――n_, I suppose, hath informed
your Ladyship of some pleasing particulars. I hope to acquaint you of
more at my return to town. In the mean while, I beg leave to subscribe
myself, honoured Madam,

                   Your Ladyship’s most obliged, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXXXVII.


                      _To the Countess of D――――._

                                           _Plymouth, Feb. 22, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

YESTERDAY I had the favour of your Ladyship’s letter, which I would
have answered immediately, but was engaged both in company, and in
preaching the everlasting gospel. Your Ladyship’s answering my poor
scrawl, was an honour I did not expect; but, since your Ladyship is
pleased thus to condescend, I am encouraged to make a reply. And give
me leave to assure your Ladyship, that your own case, and that of your
honoured sisters, have been, and are always upon my heart. I pray for
both in public and private, though none knows whom I mean. Blessed
be the GOD and Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, who, I trust, hath
imparted a saving knowledge of his eternal Son to your Ladyship’s heart.
Your letter bespeaks the language of a soul which hath tasted that the
LORD is gracious, and hath been initiated into the divine life. Welcome,
thrice welcome, honoured Madam, into the world of new creatures! O what
a scene of happiness lies before you! Your frames, my Lady, like the
moon, will wax and wane; but the LORD JESUS, on whose righteousness you
solely depend, will, notwithstanding, remain your faithful friend in
heaven. Your Ladyship seems to have the right point in view, to get a
constant abiding witness and indwelling of the blessed Spirit of GOD
in your heart. This the Redeemer has purchased for you. Of this he has
given your Ladyship a taste; this, I am persuaded, he will yet impart
so plentifully to your heart, that out of it shall flow rivers of
living waters. This JESUS spake of the Spirit, which they that believe
on him should receive. As you have, therefore, honoured Madam, received
the LORD JESUS, so walk in him even by faith. Lean on your beloved, and
you shall go on comfortably through this howling wilderness, till you
arrive at those blissful regions,

              _Where pain, and sin, and sorrow cease,_
              _And all is calm, and joy, and peace._

And O that your honoured sister may go hand in hand with your Ladyship!
Wherefore doth she doubt? Wherefore doth she fear? Why does not her
Ladyship say,

                _To the blest fountain of thy blood,_
                  _Incarnate GOD, I fly;_
                _Here let me wash my spotted soul,_
                  _From sins of crimson dye_.

Honoured Madam, is it not a fountain opened? Opened for all that will
come, and wash at, and drink of it? Entreat her Ladyship, therefore,
honoured Madam, not to be faithless, but believing. Beg her to come,
or rather be pleased to inform her Ladyship, that her Saviour entreats
and commands her to come just as she is, and to accept of salvation
as a free-gift. O that with Queen _Esther_ she may say, “If I perish,
I perish.” Then shall she see the King of kings holding out a golden
sceptre, and not an iron rod. But I forget myself again. Honoured
Madam, be pleased to pardon me, and accept what I have written as the
overflowings of a heart that hath been wrestling with GOD, for the
salvation of your Ladyship, your honoured sister, and of all related
to you. This is the best proof I can give of my being, honoured Madam,

          Your Ladyship’s most obliged, obedient, and willing
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCXXXVIII.


                     _To the Countess of H――――n._

                                             _Exeter, Feb. 24, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

AFTER I wrote to your Ladyship last post, from _Plymouth_, I received
the letters you was pleased to communicate to Mr. _C――――_. They came
quite unexpected. I think it is enough, that my letters are received,
not without being answered; but the LORD JESUS will humble me by
mercies. O that they may have that blessed effect upon my soul!
Inclosed, your Ladyship hath my answers. I have sent them open, that
your Ladyship may (if not too long) peruse them. Whilst I was writing,
the fire kindled, and I did not well know how to leave off. I rejoice
that your Ladyship hath such a promising prospect of doing good among
the rich and great. Mr. _C――――_, in his last, writes thus: “Mr. _G――――_
went with me to wait on her Ladyship; where he owns he spent two hours
with more pleasure, than he ever remembered to have done in any company
before: and, I must freely own, he spoke my own sentiments.” I believe
that your Ladyship will daily reap the fruit of a catholic spirit, and
a free conversation with the truly gracious of all denominations. It
is a conduct truly god-like. Dear Mr. _T――――_ has much of it. I parted
from him on _Thursday_ afternoon. He was once almost blinded by weeping
under the word. He was rejoiced to see the flocking at _Plymouth_.
Indeed it was very encouraging. Our LORD seemed to keep the best wine
until the last. At _Tavistock_, ten miles from _Plymouth_, I preached
last _Thursday_, but was rudely treated. For, whilst I was praying,
some of the baser sort brought a bull and dogs, and disturbed us much.
But I hope that good was done. Blessed be GOD, we know some has been
done. I conversed with three or four, that have been awakened by the
reading of some of my printed sermons. Surely the Apostle spoke like
himself, when he said, “GOD has chosen the weak things of this world,
to confound the strong; and things that are not, to bring to nought the
things that are.” I am now come thus far in my return to _London_. I
purpose, GOD willing, being there in about ten days. On _Monday_ next
I shall set out for _Bristol_; where, as I am informed, the infinitely
condescending Redeemer has been pleased greatly to bless my last visit.
When I think of _London_, I feel a kind of fear and trembling, lest
my bodily sickness should return again, and I should not speak to the
Mighty and Noble, so as to win them to the ever-blessed JESUS. But I
desire to throw myself blindfold into his hands, believing, (LORD, help
my unbelief!) that as my day is, so shall my strength be. At present,
honoured Madam, this is the language of my heart, to Him, whose I am,
and whom I desire to serve:

              _A life that all things casts behind,_
              _Springs forth obedient to thy call;_
              _A heart, that no desire can move,_
              _But still t’adore, believe, and love,_
              _Give me, my LORD, my life, my all!_

I hope this will find your Ladyship quite happy under the shadow of
redeeming love. I wish your Ladyship an increase of that happiness
every moment, as being, honoured Madam,

          Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, though most unworthy
                            humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXXXIX.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                                             _Exeter, Feb. 25, 1749._

_My dear Mr. C――――_,

YOUR last, with the inclosed, you may be sure gave me satisfaction, at
the same time as they, I trust, humbled me before him, who will send by
whom he will send. This post carries answers to the honourable women.
I suppose that you will be pleased to find I am thus far in my return
to _London_. O my friend, my friend, I come with fear and trembling. To
speak to the rich and great, so as to win them to the blessed JESUS, is
indeed a task. But wherefore do we fear? We can do all things through
CHRIST strengthening us. But why does Mr. _C――――_ think it strange,
that no-body can be found to help me in the country? Is it not more
strange, that you should lie supine as it were, burying your talents
in a napkin, complaining that you have nothing to do, and yet souls
every where are perishing about you for lack of knowledge? Why do you
not preach or print? At least, why do you not help me, or somebody
or another, in a more public way? You are in the decline of life, and
if you do not soon reassume the place, you are now, through grace,
qualified for, you may lose the opportunity of doing so for ever. I
write this in great seriousness. May the LORD give you no rest, till
you lift up your voice like a trumpet! Up, and be doing, and the LORD
will be with you. I can now no more, but inform you, that, GOD willing,
I am to be at _Bristol_ next _Tuesday_, where letters on _Wednesday_
morning may find, very dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCXL.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                             _Exeter, Feb. 27, 1749._

_Very dear Mr. S――――_,

I Am ashamed to think that your last kind letter has lain by so long
unanswered; but journeying, preaching, and a multiplicity of other
business has prevented me. I shall not carry on the debate; only I must
thank you for receiving my letter in so friendly a manner, and entreat
you, though a host of enemies are behind, and a whole sea of troubles
before you, to go forwards. That was the command the great JEHOVAH gave
to his servant _Moses_, when under very pressing circumstances, so that
he knew not what to do. The LORD’s impressing and affecting persons
under your exhortation, is a token for good. It is good to be led on
step by step into whatever plan providence intends to call us. “He
that believeth doth not make haste.” Our business is to follow, and
improve the light we have, and that is the way to get more. You know
who hath said, “to him that hath shall be given, and he shall have more
abundance.” May this promise be fulfilled in your heart! But why does
my friend write so about assurance, or think he is too sinful to expect
such a favour? Have you learnt CHRIST no better yet? Who more sinful
than _Paul_ or the jaylor, _Zaccheus_ or _Magdalene_? and who more
assured of their salvation? My dear Mr. _S――――_, do not think so hardly
of the glorious Redeemer. Draw near to him with boldness, though the
greatest of sinners, and urge that as an argument, why he should give
you the greatest and most abiding assurance of his everlasting love.
This is the only argument I can use in respect to my own soul. Fear
not, dear Sir, though clouds return after the rain; ere long I trust
the glorious and ever-blessed spirit will not, as to his comforts, be
like a way-faring man, tarrying only for a night, but come and make
a continued abode in your heart. The language of my soul for you is,
“Come LORD JESUS, come quickly!” May I expect an answer to this in
_London_. Thither I am now going from the west, where I have been for
about a month, and through grace have seen that the seed sown just
before my embarking last for _America_, has sprung up and produced
fruit unto GOD. To him be all the glory. The impressions made upon some
of the great ones do remain. Good Lady _H――――_ sends me good news. Be
pleased to remember me as usual to doctor _D――――_ and Mr. _H――――_, and
believe me to be, very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXLI.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. H――――._

                                            _Bristol, March 1, 1749._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

I Am much obliged to you for your last kind letter. It was so agreeable,
that I sent it to good Lady _H――――_. Her Ladyship writes me word “that
it was a letter after her own heart.” She loves a Catholic spirit, and
I trust you are not deceived in your thoughts concerning me in this
respect. If I know any thing of my desperately wicked and deceitful
heart, I truly love all that love the glorious _Emmanuel_, and though I
cannot depart from the principles which I believe are clearly revealed
in the book of GOD, yet I can chearfully associate with those that
differ from me, if I have reason to think they are united to our common
head. This induced me to call upon good Mr. _L――――_, whose books many
years ago were blessed to my soul, when the work that is now spreading,
was then only in embryo. I am just come from the west, where I have
had the pleasure of seeing the seed sown just before I last embarked
for _America_, sprung up and bearing much fruit. All glory be to Him
who alone giveth the increase. I have also had two letters from some
honourable women, who I trust have received the grace of GOD in truth;
and Lady _H――――n_ writes me word, that “the prospect of doing good at
my return to _London_ is very encouraging.” Thither I am now bound. I
go with fear and trembling, knowing how difficult it is to speak to the
great, so as to win them to JESUS CHRIST. I sometimes am ready to say,
“LORD, I pray thee have me excused, and send by whom thou wilt send.”
But divine grace is sufficient for me. I can do all things through
CHRIST strengthening me. My dear brother, fail not to pray for me, that
I may hold on and hold out to the end, and in prosperity and adversity
press forward with an even, chearful, meek and lowly mind towards the
mark, for the prize of our high calling in CHRIST JESUS. I am glad
to hear that doctor _S――――_ goes on so well. I guess he will not be
suffered long to halt. It is no matter how soon all worldly shackles
are knocked off, and persons set at liberty (supposing they have a
proper call) to range for GOD. I find there is no hopes of compromising
matters. Nobody can be ordained that is a Methodist. Well! the time may
come, when many of the priests also shall be obedient to the word.
They come last; but then many of them come together. I know you will
say, Amen! let me hear from you shortly again. You shall have as quick
returns as can be given you by, my dear brother,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_Honoured Madam_,

HAVING been moving this week from place to place, I could not write
to your Ladyship as usual, and even now my body is so fatigued, that I
cannot say much. However, I would beg leave to inform your Ladyship
that the glorious _Emmanuel_ continues to smile upon my poor labours,
and that about the middle of the week, by his leave, I purpose waiting
upon your Ladyship in _North Audley-street_. I doubt not but I shall
find your Ladyship riper for heaven, than when I left _London_. There
you will be always thronged with company, and yet free from the least
distraction. On earth it is otherwise. However, as we advance in the
divine life, we shall be more and more conformed to those ministring
spirits, who, though waiting on us below, do always behold the face of
our heavenly Father above. This divine lesson, honoured madam, GOD has
begun to teach you. May you daily make a proficiency therein, so that
your progress may be made known unto all men! I will follow as fast as
I can, though alas! with too slow a pace. I must now add no more, but
my usual prayers for your Ladyship’s temporal and eternal welfare, and
hasten to subscribe myself, honoured madam,

     Your Ladyship’s most dutiful though unworthy humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXLIII.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

_Dear Billy_,

I Have just now heard, that a ship will sail for _Philadelphia_ in a
day or two. I cannot therefore miss the opportunity of acknowledging
the receipt of your last kind letter. I am sorry it brought me such bad
news concerning the state of religion in your parts. My constant prayer
for you, and my other _Philadelphia_ friends is this, “LORD, revive
thy work in the midst of the years.” Notwithstanding so wide a door
is opened here, and a prospect of doing much good lies before me, yet
I have settled thoughts of embarking for _America_ in the fall. But
future things belong to GOD. His I am, and I desire to be entirely at
his alwise disposal. My wife is not yet arrived; I hear she is yet
upon the water. May the LORD JESUS be her convoy! I am just returned
from an excursion of about six hundred miles in the west, where I had
the pleasure of seeing, that the seed sown before I embarked last for
_America_, had been blessed abundantly. Glory be to Him, who alone has
given the increase. The news you have had of my preaching to some great
ones, is true; I have done it for some time twice a week, and thanks
be to the blessed Redeemer, it has already produced good effects. Lady
_H――――_ is a mirror of piety indeed. In time, I trust of the honourable
women there will not be a few, who dare to confess the LORD JESUS
before men. You must remember me to all. I have scarce time to write
this, so can only send one general salutation. The LORD JESUS be with
all your spirits, Amen and Amen! The bearer, Mr. _H――――_, seems to be
well recommended as an honest man. He is an entire stranger to every
body in _America_, and I believe has a mind to settle in _Philadelphia_.
I am desired to write a line in his behalf. You will do what you can
for him, because he is a stranger. I could write much more, but am
interrupted. Adieu, my dear man, for the present. Pray keep near the
ever-blessed Redeemer, and fail not to pray for and write to

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXLIV.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                            _London, March 11, 1749._

_My very dear Mr. S――――_,

I Wish you joy. I trust you may now say, “Now I begin to be a disciple
of JESUS CHRIST.” You know who has commanded us to rejoice and be
exceeding glad when men separate from our company, and speak all manner
of evil against us falsely for his name’s sake. Thanks be to GOD, you
have at length found out, that whosoever attempts to reconcile GOD and
the world, is attempting to reconcile two irreconcilable differences.
They are as opposite as light and darkness, heaven and hell. You have
nothing to do, but to go on doing, and then sing with an holy triumph,

              _For this let men revile my name,_
              _I shun no cross, I fear no shame;_
              _All hail reproach, and welcome pain,_
              _Only thy terrors, LORD, restrain._

You know he is faithful, who hath promised, “that he will never leave
nor forsake you.” Wait on him therefore, dear Sir, and you shall renew
your strength, nay you shall mount on wings like an eagle; you shall
walk and not be weary, you shall run and not be faint. Various are
the trials inward and outward that you will meet with. It is in the
spiritual as in the natural birth. The after-pangs are sometimes
sharper than those that precede the new-birth itself. If you are made
use of by JESUS CHRIST, no wonder that satan desires to have you, that
he may sift you as wheat. But fear not; JESUS prays for you; your faith
therefore shall not fail. How was _Paul_ humbled and struck down before
he was sent forth to preach the everlasting gospel? Prayer, temptation,
and meditation, says _Luther_, are necessary ingredients for a minister.
If GOD teaches us humility, it must be as _Gideon_ taught the men of
_Succoth_, by thorns. This I suppose is what dear Mr. _H――――_ means; he
has been conversant with Mr. _L――――_, and writes much therefore in his
way. I find he is for making thorough work of it, and digging deep in
order to build high. He is certainly right; but why we should not press
after and continually plead for assurance, which is every where through
the holy scriptures spoken of as the common portion of GOD’s children,
I cannot yet see. It is a false humility to be content without that
which GOD offers and promises to give. Let him give it in his own way
and time; but, “LORD give me a full assurance of faith, that I may
joy and rejoice in thee evermore!” should be the constant cry of your
soul. My dear Sir, I could enlarge, but I must away to our good Lady
_H――――n_’s. You must not expect to see her till _August_. I preached at
her Ladyship’s on _Thursday_, and am to do so weekly. I expect to leave
town in about a month. Pray let me see you if possible. A new scene
will open to you, now you begin to act publickly for CHRIST; but I must
bid you farewel. Adieu. May the LORD JESUS be with your spirit! Write
often, and you shall be answered, GOD willing, as speedy as possible by,
my very dear friend,

                           Ever yours whilst
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXLV.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. G――――._

                                            _London, March 17, 1749._

_My dear Brother_,

WHAT a blessed thing it is, that we can write to, when we cannot see
one another! By this means we increase our joys, and lessen our sorrows,
and as it were exchange hearts. Thanks be to the LORD JESUS, that the
work flourishes with you. I am glad your children grow so fast; they
become fathers soon; I wish some may not prove dwarfs at last. A word
to the wise is sufficient. I have always found awakening times like
spring times. Many blossoms, but not always so much fruit. But go on,
my dear man, and in the strength of the LORD you shall do valiantly.
I long to be your way, but I suppose it will be two months first. My
love awaits Mrs. _H――――_ and all that love the LORD JESUS in sincerity.
Pray tell my dear Mr. _I――――_ that I cannot now answer the _Preston_
letter, being engaged in answering a virulent pamphlet, entitled, “_The
Enthusiasm of the Methodists and Papists compared_,” supposed to be
done by the Bishop of _E――――_. Thus it must be. If we will be temple
builders, we must have temple builders lot; I mean, hold a sword in one
hand and a trowel in the other. The LORD make us faithful _Nehemiahs_,
for we have many _Sanballats_ to deal with! but wherefore should we
fear? If CHRIST be for us, who can be against us? _Nil desperandum,
christo duce_, is the christian’s motto. My dear brother, good night.
May the LORD JESUS be with your spirit, and make you wise to win souls,
even wise as an angel of GOD! Remember me in the kindest manner to
honest hearted Mr. _I――――_, and tell him, that in a post or two I hope
he will hear again from

        His and your most affectionate though unworthy brother
               and fellow-labourer in CHRIST’s vineyard,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXLVI.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. W――――._

                                             _London, April 5, 1749._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

YOU cannot well tell how much satisfaction your last kind letter
gave me. It was like yourself, like a father in CHRIST, to write to
strengthen the hands of one, who is not yet half your age, but I trust
ready to spend and be spent for the good of precious and immortal souls.
I see that you have heard how kind my enemies have been to me. They
have told me of my faults, and by their opposition have given me an
opportunity of confessing them. I am just now publishing a pamphlet, in
answer to one published against the Methodists, upon the title-page of
which I intend to have these words, “Out of the eater came forth meat.”
O how good, how infinitely wise is JESUS CHRIST! How careful to cause
all things to work together for good to those who love him. I have
reason to speak well of him, as a promise-keeping Saviour. I doubt not,
but he will greatly bless and own you in the latter stages of the road,
and cause you to go off like a ripe shock of corn. It will rejoice
you to hear that conviction work is going on in _England_ and _Wales_.
I believe the holy spirit is powerfully working on some of the Rich,
and the Poor seem rather more eager than ever to hear the gospel. I am
much engaged, so that I have scarce time to see or write to any; but in
heaven there will be time enough, and but just enough too:

                  _For O eternity’s too short,_
                  _To utter all CHRIST’s praise_.

You will be pleased to return my most cordial salutations to your wife,
and all that desire the welfare of such a worthless worm. As our common
Lord enables, you and they shall be remembered by, Reverend and very
dear Sir,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXLVII.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. H――――._

                                             _London, April 5, 1749._

_Rev. and dear Sir_,

YOUR kind letter would not have lain by me unanswered so long, had I
not been necessarily employed in affairs of immediate consequence. At
Lady _H――――_’s request, I read part of it to some of the nobility, who
approved of it very much. By your leave, I will put a sentence or two
of it, without mentioning names, into a pamphlet I am now fitting for
the press. I suppose you have seen it advertised. I want to own and
publicly confess my public mistakes. O how many, how great have they
been! How much obliged am I to my enemies for telling me of them! I
wish you could see my pamphlet before it comes out. I just now wrote
to Doctor _S――――_ to see if he cannot meet me this day sevennight, or
contrive some way for conveyance of my little piece to him. O that it
may be blessed to promote GOD’s glory, and the good of souls! You will
be glad to hear that our LORD has given us a good passover, and that
the prospect is still encouraging among the Rich. I intend leaving
town in about a week, and to begin ranging after precious souls.――But
I shall wait for the doctor’s answer. You judge right when you say,
“it is your opinion that I do not want to make a sect, or set myself
at the head of a party.” No, let the name of _Whitefield_ die, so that
the cause of JESUS CHRIST may live. I have seen enough of popularity
to be sick of it, and did not the interest of my blessed Master
require my appearing in public, the world should hear but little of
me henceforward. But who can desert such a cause? Who, for fear of
a little contempt and suffering, would decline the service of such a
Master? O that the LORD JESUS may thrust out many, many labourers into
his harvest? Surely the time must come, when many of the priests also
shall be obedient to the word. I wait for thy salvation, O LORD!――But
I must bid you farewel. Praying that you may grow under the cross, and
be enabled to flourish unconsumed in fire, I subscribe myself, Reverend
and dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXLVIII.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                        _Gloucester, April 15, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

IT has given me some concern, to think that I was so long in town after
I took leave of your Ladyship, and could neither see nor write to you.
The last letter I was about to write, I found myself too ill to hold a
pen long enough in my hand to finish it. Blessed be GOD, I find myself
now much better. Travelling, as usual, does me service, and the joy
of the LORD supplies the want of bodily strength. Ere long I hope to
send your Ladyship some good news out of the country. I came hither
this morning, and am to preach to night. In a post or two your Ladyship
may expect to hear from me again. In the mean while my prayers will
be continually putting up, that you may increase with all the increase
of GOD. I hope the elect countess is perfectly recovered of her
late indisposition, and that Lady _Fanny_, _H――――_, _C――――_, &c. are
determined to go on in that narrow way which leads to everlasting
life. Before I left town, I desired Mr. _H――――_ to send your Ladyship
a dozen of my pamphlets, to be presented to the foresaid Ladies, and
to whomsoever your Ladyship shall please besides. As many more may
be had as your Ladyship sends for. May the LORD give it his blessing,
and cause me to grow wiser and better by all his various dispensations
towards me. I shall now take my leave; and after wishing your Ladyship,
and the other honourable women that are seeking JESUS, much of that
rest which remains for the people of GOD, I shall subscribe myself,
honoured Madam,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXLIX.


                       _To the Countess D――――._

                                           _Bristol, April 19, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

THE unfeigned regard I have for your Ladyship, will not suffer me to
be long out of _London_ without sending a line to enquire after your
Ladyship’s welfare. I hope this will find you perfectly recovered from,
or meekly resigned under, your late bodily indisposition. I believe
your Ladyship hath reason to say, “It is good for me, that I have
been afflicted;”――and sanctified afflictions are undoubtedly signs of
special love. To come purified out of the furnace, and to find that
some of our dross is purged away by the LORD’s putting us into the fire,
is indeed an evidence that he is praying for us, and that our faith,
however tried, shall not finally fail. O Madam, what a blessing is
it to be able to say, “I know in whom I have believed!” How does such
an assurance sweeten every bitter cup, and make even death itself
to appear with an angel’s face! O that all who are destitute of this
unspeakable gift, were convinced of their want thereof, and set upon
hungering and thirsting after it! I hope your honoured sister will be
one of these. I have her Ladyship much upon my heart, and do earnestly
pray that she may be strengthened, established, and settled in the
love of GOD, and determine to know nothing but JESUS CHRIST and him
crucified. I send her Ladyship my most dutiful respects, and beg you
would accept of the same, from, honoured Madam,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCL.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                           _Portsmouth, May 8, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

GLAD, very glad was I to hear, in a letter sent me by Mr. _H――――_, that
your Ladyship was better; and glad am I, yea very glad, that I can send
your Ladyship good news from this part of the country. The night after
I came here, I preached to many thousands, a great body of whom was
attentive, but some of the baser sort made a little disturbance. A very
great opposer sent for me to his house immediately, and could scarce
refrain weeping all the time I was with him. On the _Friday_ evening I
preached at _Gosport_, where the mob has generally been very turbulent,
but all was hushed and quiet, and as far as I could find, all approved.
Every time the word has seemed to sink deeper and deeper into the
people’s hearts, and their affections seem to be more and more drawn
out. In short, I hope I can inform your Ladyship that _Portsmouth_ is
taken, and that we shall hear of many who will in earnest seek after
the one thing needful. I have a great mind to go to the isle of _Wight_,
but am not yet determined. Here is a knot of sincere souls, that seem
to love the LORD JESUS in sincerity. Several date their awakenings
from their hearing _T―――― G――――_, who I hear is to be ordained by the
Bishop of _W――――_, but I doubt it. Last night I had sweet conversation
with two of the devout soldiers that have been abroad. They are
soldiers indeed. Blessed be GOD, that there are so many of his children
scattered up and down, who I trust will give him no rest, till he makes
_Jerusalem_ a praise through the whole earth. I do not forget Lady
_F――――_, the Countess, or any of those who seemed inclined to follow
JESUS of _Nazareth_. O that they may be steady, and be enabled with
full purpose of heart to cleave unto the LORD! I beg that my most
humble and dutiful respects may find acceptance with them and your
Ladyship, from, honoured madam,

         Your Ladyship’s most obliged, obedient humble servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCLI.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. M――――._

                                          _Portsmouth, May 11, 1749._

_Rev. and very dear Sir_,

IT concerns me much, that one whom I so much honour, and so dearly
love in the bowels of JESUS, should hear so seldom from me. Twice
have I endeavoured to answer your last kind letter, but have been
prevented, by want of health, a multiplicity of business, and frequent
removes from place to place. About three weeks ago I was sent for up
to _London_ to see my wife, but she is not yet arrived. However, it has
been over-ruled to the bringing me here, where I have been preaching
every day for this week past, to very large and attentive auditories,
who come to hear with great eagerness. I hear of many that are brought
under convictions, prejudices seem to be universally removed, and a
people that but a week ago were speaking all manner of evil against me,
are now very desirous of my staying longer amongst them to preach the
everlasting gospel. What cannot GOD do? After I remove hence, I purpose,
GOD willing, to take a tour into _Wales_, where Mr. _H――――_ tells me
the work is upon the advance. We have lately renewed our connection,
and whether I stay in _England_ or go abroad, he and some more have
agreed, in the strength of the LORD, to continue preaching at the
Tabernacle and elsewhere as formerly. At _London_, matters have
advanced successfully. Real good has certainly been done among the
Rich, and the Poor receive the gospel with as much gladness as ever.
My outward embarrassments are much lessened, and I hope ere long to be
able to say, “I owe no man any thing but love.” Many doors are open,
and I have thoughts, if possible, of seeing _Scotland_ this year.
But at present I am in a strait, and continually saying, “LORD, what
wouldest thou have me to do?” Sometimes I think I must either drop my
_English_ or _American_ work; but our LORD knows best how to dispose of
me. I would be as clay in his hands, and ready to go whithersoever he
is pleased to call me. I should be glad to hear of a revival at _C――――_;
but, dear Sir, you have already seen such things as are seldom seen
above once in a century. I am afraid that some good men’s calculations
about the latter-day glory are premature, and that it is not so near
at hand as some imagine. This is our comfort, a thousand years in the
LORD’s sight are but as one day. He that comes, will come, and will not
tarry. Take courage, my dear Mr. _M――――_; look up, and go on your way
rejoicing. You will remember me most kindly to your dear yoke-fellow,
_Nathaniel_, little _R――――_, and the young student in your house, and
all dear friends. Indeed I do not forget though I cannot write to you.
GOD will not forget your works of faith, and the many favours conferred
on, my very dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in CHRIST JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLII.


                       _To the Countess D――――._

                                          _Portsmouth, May 12, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Just now rose from my knees, and have been interceding for you at the
throne of grace. The same principle that led me to pray for, excites
me also to write a few lines to your Ladyship. Ere now your late
bodily indisposition, I hope is entirely removed, and you are up and
ministring to JESUS CHRIST. I doubt not but your Ladyship will be
helped to sing with a dear saint now with GOD,

                _――――O happy rod,_
                _That brought me nearer to my GOD._

The end of all affliction, outward and inward, is to make us more and
more partakers of a divine nature. The father of mercies hath dealt
bountifully with your Ladyship; he hath blessed you in the decline of
life. O that your latter end may greatly increase! May you be filled
with all the fulness of GOD! This, Madam, is the privilege of a real
christian, always growing, and making perpetual advances in the divine
life. The path of the just shines more and more unto the perfect day.
The way, thanks be to GOD, your Ladyship knows. We must always come by
faith, and be continually drawing out of the Redeemer’s inexhaustible
fulness. If we are enabled to lean on him, we shall go comfortably
on in a wilderness. That is the best name this world deserves. Cieled
houses, gaudy attire, and rich furniture, do not make it appear less
so to a mind truly enlightened to see the beauties that are in JESUS of
_Nazareth_. These are things, which a watchful, well-informed christian
will always look on with a jealous eye, lest they should divert him
from looking unto JESUS the author and finisher of his faith. But I
need not write thus to your Ladyship, the native language of whose
heart I trust is, “GOD forbid that I should glory save in the cross of
CHRIST, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.”
The preaching of the cross hath been much blessed here. Multitudes
daily attend, and many are much affected. It would please your Ladyship
to see the alteration that has been made in a week’s time. But what
cannot GOD do? All things are possible to him. I hope your Ladyship
will not forget a poor pilgrim in your prayers. Neither you nor your
honoured sister are forgotten by him. I send most dutiful respects and
grateful acknowledgments to her Ladyship and Lady _G――――_ _H――――_, and
shall only now add, that I am, honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most obliged, obedient humble servant,
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLIII.


                        _To Lady F―――― S――――._

                                          _Portsmouth, May 12, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

AS I am uncertain whether good Lady _H――――_ be in town, I make bold
to inclose a line to your Ladyship in a letter I have just written
to the elect Countess _D――――_. Gratitude constrains me to take the
freedom, and the conviction I have that your Ladyship’s face is set
_Zion_-wards, makes me think it will not be altogether unacceptable.
With great pleasure I often reflect on that good work, which I trust
the ever-blessed GOD has begun in your soul. My heart’s desire and
continual prayer unto him is, that your Ladyship, having put your hand
to the plough, may be kept from looking back! Satan will not be wanting
to exert his utmost efforts to divert you from the cross. He knows
of what influence your Ladyship’s example must necessarily be, and
therefore will always be striving to persuade your Ladyship at least
to compound matters, and to attempt to reconcile two irreconcilable
differences, CHRIST and the world. But your Ladyship is too well
grounded to hearken to his delusive insinuations, and too noble to
refuse to give your whole heart to Him who has bought it with no less
price than that of his own most precious blood.――What a price is now
put into your Ladyship’s hands! What a glorious opportunity is now
afforded you, to shew even before kings, that we are made kings indeed,
and priests unto GOD, and that it is our privilege as christians to
reign over sin, death, hell, the world, and ourselves, even whilst here
on earth. Methinks I see angels gazing to see how your Ladyship acts
your part. O that the angel of the everlasting covenant may always
accompany you, and by the power of his eternal and all-conquering
spirit, enable your Ladyship to fight the good fight of faith, and run
with patience the glorious race that is set before you! He is never
wanting to those that put their trust in him. Ask and you shall receive,
seek and you shall find, be always knocking, and a door of mercy shall
be always opened unto you. O the happiness of a life wholly devoted to,
and spent in communion and fellowship with the ever-blessed GOD! It is
indeed heaven begun on earth. May your Ladyship taste of it more and
more every day and every hour! Blessed be GOD, I trust some in these
parts, who a few days ago had never heard of, now begin to look after
this kingdom of GOD. A more visible alteration I have not seen made in
a people for some time. At first some of the baser sort made a noise,
but ever since, thousands have attended in the greatest order, numbers
have been and are affected, and through their importunity I have been
prevailed on to stay longer than I designed. O to be instrumental to
bring only one soul to JESUS CHRIST! But whither am I running? Honoured
Madam, your goodness will excuse this freedom. I believe your Ladyship
will be glad to hear such tidings. It is the best way I can think of to
express my gratitude for the many unmerited favours your Ladyship hath
been pleased to confer on, honoured Madam,

          Your Ladyship’s most obliged and ready servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLIV.


                      _To the Countess of H――――._

                                          _Portsmouth, May 13, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

WITH some degree of impatience have I been waiting to hear from your
Ladyship, being very solicitous for your Ladyship’s welfare. This
morning your Ladyship’s unexpected letter surprized me. I only expected
to have a line from Mrs. _C――――_. Your Ladyship’s writing under
such weakness, put me in mind of Mr. _C――――_, who, when his friends
advised him not to write on account of his illness, made this reply,
“What! would you have my master come and find me idle?” Perhaps our
LORD is fitting your Ladyship for some new work. _Luther_ observed,
that “he was never employed in any new thing, but he was beset with
some temptations, or visited with a fit of sickness.” I only wish I
could bear it for your Ladyship; but then your crown would not be so
bright, nor the inward purity of your heart so great. The more trials
when sanctified, the more conformed we shall be to the ever-loving
ever-lovely JESUS. O that the LORD of all Lords may water you every
moment, and cause you to flourish like the burning bush unconsumed in
fire! I have more good news to send your Ladyship from _Portsmouth_.
Ever since my last, the prospect of doing good has increased. Thousands
have attended, and even when it rained, when one could reasonably
expect but very few, some thousands came to hear the word. I have
contracted a cold by preaching in the rain; but what is that, if any
soul can but get good!

                _My life, my blood, I here present,_
                _If in thy cause they may be spent;_
                _Fulfil thy sov’reign counsel, LORD;_
                _Thy will be done, thy name ador’d._

On next _Monday_ evening I intend, GOD willing, to set out for
_Salisbury_, and from thence shall write to your Ladyship again.
Yesterday I wrote to the Countess and Lady _F――――_, but did not send
the letters to your Ladyship, not knowing but you might have set
out for _Bristol_. My brother would be highly delighted to have your
Ladyship under his roof. That GOD may restore you to perfect health,
and make you a blessing to thousands, is and shall be the constant
prayer of, honoured Madam,

         Your Ladyship’s most obliged, dutiful, sympathizing,
                    though unworthy humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCLV.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                             _Bristol, May 22, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

SINCE I wrote last to your Ladyship, several things have concurred to
prove that Providence directed my way hither. I have preached three
times, and each time our LORD caused the word to leave a blessing
behind it. Yesterday, congregations were very large in the fields. This
evening I am to preach again, and to-morrow, GOD willing, I set out for
_Wales_.――Though my brother is sorry for the occasion, yet he rejoices
very much that he is to be honoured with your Ladyship’s company. I
believe you will find his house very commodious, and I am persuaded
your Ladyship’s coming will prove a blessing to him. Surely our LORD
is only purging you that you may bring forth more fruit. I am always
thinking of, and praying for your Ladyship’s perfect recovery. I am
now reduced to great weakness myself, but the joy of the LORD is my
strength, and through his help I shall leap over every wall. Gladly
would I help to bear all your Ladyship’s burdens, and thereby evidence
how much I am, honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s dutiful, sympathizing, obliged,
                     though most unworthy servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLVI.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                         _Abergavenny, May 27, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

THOUGH I suppose your Ladyship will not be at _Bristol_ so soon as this
reaches it, yet as this is the most leisure time I am likely to have
these three weeks, I cannot help writing a few lines to wait for your
Ladyship at my brother’s house. I think (as I am persuaded he does also)
that he is highly honoured in having your Ladyship under his roof, and
I earnestly pray the LORD of all Lords to bless the waters, for the
recovery of your health. Though I want to die myself, yet methinks I
would have others live, especially such as, like your Ladyship, are
placed upon a pinnacle, and in a particular manner set up as lights
in the world. For two days past I have been at my wife’s house for
the sake of a little retirement. It has been sweet, yea very sweet, so
sweet that I should be glad never to be heard of again. But this must
not be. A necessity is laid upon me, and woe is me if I do not preach
the gospel of CHRIST. GOD willing, I therefore purpose to-morrow
to begin a three weeks circuit, and to see what the LORD will be
pleased to do by me. The country is alarmed, and I hear very numerous
congregations are expected. Your Ladyship shall hear from time to time.
May the ever blessed GOD fill you with all his fulness, and after you
have done and suffered what he hath appointed for you here, translate
you to partake of an exceeding and eternal weight of glory in his
kingdom hereafter. So prays, honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obedient, obliged
                          humble servant, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLVII.


                                         _Abergavenny, May 27, 1749._

_My very dear Brother_,

INCLOSED you have a letter for our good Lady _H――――_, whom I suppose
you will have the honour of receiving in a few days under your roof.
Both before, and ever since I left _Bristol_, I have been frequently
thinking of the unspeakable mercies, that the infinitely great and
glorious GOD is pleased to pour down upon us.――Surely the language of
both our hearts ought to be, “What shall we render unto the LORD?” For
my part, I am lost in wonder, and want a thousand lives to spend in the
Redeemer’s service. O let not my dear brother be angry, if I intreat
him at length to leave off killing, and begin to redeem time. A concern
for your eternal welfare so affects me, that it often brings bodily
sickness upon me, and drives me to a throne of grace, to wrestle in
your behalf. Even now, whilst I am writing, my soul is agonizing in
prayer for you, hoping I shall see that day, when you will have poured
out on you a spirit of grace and of supplication, and look to him whom
we have pierced, and be made to mourn as one mourneth for a first-born.
Till this be done, all resolutions, all schemes for amendment, will be
only like spiders webs. Nature is a mere Proteus, and till renewed by
the spirit of GOD, though it may shift its scene, will be only nature
still. Apply then, my dearest Brother, to the fountain of light and
life, from whence every good and perfect gift cometh. A worthy woman in
all probability is going to throw herself under GOD, into your hands.
A considerable addition will be then made to your present talents, and
consequently a greater share of care and circumspection necessary to
improve all for the glory of Him, who hath been always preventing and
following you with his blessings. Should you prove any otherwise than
a pious husband, it will be one of the greatest afflictions I ever met
with in my life. At present you can only hurt yourself, which is hurt
enough; but then (forgive me, my dear Brother,) I am jealous over you
with a godly jealousy. My fears shall be turned into prayers, and I
will follow this letter with strong crying unto GOD in your behalf. My
retirement here these two days hath been very sweet; but to-morrow I
begin a three weeks circuit. Next sabbath I am to be at _Carmarthen_,
the _Friday_ following at _Haverford-west_. For the present, adieu.
That you may take CHRIST to be your All in All, and that the remainder
of your life may be one continued sacrifice of love to him, who hath
shed his precious blood for you, is the hearty prayer of, my dear
Brother,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCLVIII.


                            _To Mr. D――――._

                                         _Abergavenny, May 27, 1749._

_My very dear Friend_,

YOUR kind letter I received at _Bristol_, but have not had time to
answer it till now. You know what a moving life I lead. It is for one,
who laid down his life for me. I want my last remove to come. Blessed
be GOD for your recovery from your late indisposition. Many of GOD’s
people will have reason to be thankful on your behalf. I trust I am;
and earnestly pray the LORD of all Lords, that as your day is, so your
strength may be. I thank you for minding the poor widows, and the other
poor tabernacle petitioners. What an honour is put upon you! To be
CHRIST’s almoner is no mean office. You shall be rewarded ere long
before men and angels. Mrs. _D――――_ shall share with you; and as you
have been helpers of each others faith, so shall you be partakers of
the same glory. May your latter end greatly increase, and may you be
enabled to bring forth fruit even to a good old age! I hope good has
been done at _Bristol_. We had three good seasons there. To-morrow
I set out on a three weeks circuit through _Wales_. I have been here
these two days for a little retirement: it has been very sweet. On
_Thursday_ I saw Mr. _E―――― I――――_, the dissenting minister I before
spoke of, and found him very meanly apparelled. He is a most worthy man,
and from his zeal for GOD some time ago, he sold fifteen pounds worth
of his books to finish a small Meeting-house in which he preaches. He
has but three pounds per annum from the fund, and about as much from
his people. He lives very low, but enjoys much of GOD, and hath as
great understanding in the figurative parts of scripture as any one I
know of in the world. He is a _Zachary_, and his wife an _Elizabeth_.
Four or five guineas might be bestowed on them. What a scene will open
at the great day! How many _rich Priests_ will stand confounded, whilst
the poor despised _faithful Ministers_ of CHRIST shall enter, after all
their tribulation, into the joy of their LORD. I tremble for the one,
I rejoice in the foresight of the happiness of the other. May my latter
end and future state (however I may be disposed of in the mean while)
be like theirs! I know you will say, _Amen_. But what am I doing? I am
robbing the poor of your time. Away to your work in the strength of GOD,
and whilst you are feeding others, may the LORD JESUS feast your soul!
My heartiest respects attend Mrs. _D――――_. She always shares in the
petitions put up for you by, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLIX.


                         _To Mr. I―――― C――――._

                                          _Carmarthen, June 5, 1749._

_Dear Jemmy_,

AS I have a peculiar love for you and your wife, I need not inform
you that your letter, which gave me an account of her great illness,
affected me much. I have not failed to remember her at the throne of
grace, and I trust this will find her either relieved from her pain,
or resigned to his will who orders all things well. Parting is hard to
those who, like you two, have walked in love. But we can do all things
through JESUS CHRIST strengthening us. She, when dead, will live for
ever, and GOD will be to you better than seven wives. Pray salute the
dear woman for me in the tenderest manner. O that she may be strong in
the LORD, and in the power of his might, and be enabled to say, “the
cup which my father hath given me, shall I not drink it?” I sympathize
with poor Mrs. _N――――_ as well as you. GOD comfort and support you all.
We must all be tried. I am still in suspense about my wife: but, what
is best, (Glory be to GOD!) the gospel runs and is glorified! I have
been enabled to preach fourteen times within these eight days, and
the word has every where fallen with weight and power. Yesterday was a
great day here indeed. This morning I am going toward _Haverford-west_,
and am to be at _Abergavenny_ to-morrow fortnight. I know you will
continually pray for me. You know under what character, even as the
chief of sinners, but

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCLX.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                      _Haverford-west, June 8, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

SINCE my coming into _Wales_, and leaving _Carmarthen_, the infinitely
great and infinitely condescending Redeemer has been pleased to ride on
in the chariot of the everlasting gospel. Congregations grow larger and
larger, and all the towns here about are quite open for the word of GOD.
Yesterday I preached very near _Pembroke_, to-day and next LORD’s day
I am to preach here, and to-morrow at _St. David’s_. Not a dog stirs a
tongue. The mayor and gentlemen at _Pembroke_ were very civil, and the
justices here are very fond of having me in _Haverford-west_. I wish I
had more time in these parts. The fields are indeed white, ready unto
harvest, and the young men bred up at _Carmarthen_ Academy were much
taken. The congregations consist of many thousands, and their behaviour
is very affecting. Indeed we have blessed seasons. O free grace! Here
is a dear young man, just ripe for orders. He has good parts, and hath
made some proficiency in the languages, is solid, and of some influence
in this town. He can get testimonials, and if ordained I believe would
be eminently useful in the church. I wish a way could be found out
for his admission: but I fear it is impracticable. However, I thought
it my duty just to hint it to your Ladyship. May the great Shepherd
and Bishop of souls find out means for sending him, and many more
like-minded, into his vineyard! But how is your Ladyship’s health? I
begin to be quite uneasy, because I have received no letter from my
brother. I despair of hearing now till _Tuesday_ sevennight, when I
hope to be at _Abergavenny_ again. In the mean while, my prayers are
always going to the throne of grace in behalf of your Ladyship, and
every branch of your noble family. That they may take root downwards,
and bear fruit upwards, is the ardent desire of, honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, though unworthy servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLXI.


                            _To Dr. S――――._

                                          _Landovery, June 14, 1749._

_Dear Sir_,

A Few days ago, I received a letter from Mr. _C――――_, in which yours
to him dated _May_ 20th was inclosed. It gave me some concern, and
would have given me more had not the same letter informed me that good
Lady _H――――n_ had written to you herself. Alas, my dear friend, what
needless trouble do you give yourself, and into what difficulties
does your fear of man, your too great attachment to the world, and
an over-weening fondness for your pretty character, every day bring
you! Is it not time to drop our correspondence, when, on so slight
an information, you could so much as suspect that I had betrayed that
confidence you reposed in me, or believe that I read a letter wherein
you declared yourself a _Methodist_, when I had never such letter from
you. The only passage, as far as I can remember, that was read (and
that too at my Lady’s request, if I mistake not) was that noble one
wherein you said, “Let the world take my character, and tear it to
pieces, &c.” Are you ashamed, my dear friend, of the resolution? Or
think you to put that in practice, and shun being called a _Methodist_?
You might as well attempt to reach heaven with your hand; for, blessed
be GOD, such an honour has he put upon the Methodists, that whoever
renounces the world and takes up CHRIST’s cross, and believes and lives
the doctrines of Grace, must be stiled a Methodist whether he will
or not. Formerly it was “You are a Puritan,” now it is, “You are a
Methodist.” And why does my dear Mr. _S――――_ take such pains to declare,
he never will join the Methodists? Who ever asked him? Or what service
could you do their cause by joining, unless your heart was more
enstranged from the world than at present it is? Would to GOD you
was more like-minded with Mr. _H――――_! He seems to have set down, and
counted the cost. He seems to have begun at the right end, and to be
fully convinced that there is no reconciling CHRIST and the world,
GOD and _Mammon_. My dear Mr. _S――――_, suffer me to be free with you.
Our LORD I trust has begun a good work in your soul: but indeed you
have many lessons yet to learn. The great physician must give many a
bitter portion, in order to purge out the opinion you have of your own
importance, and the too great desire you have to keep in with the world.
Reproach you cannot shun, if you appear but a little for CHRIST; and
you will not have more, perhaps not so much, if you shew quite out.
Perhaps you may say, I have done this already; do not then be ashamed
of it, but go on, grow in grace, press forwards, and then I care not
what declaration you make of your not intending to be a _Methodist_. Be
a consistent christian, live above the world, call not the fear of man
christian prudence, and then underneath you shall be GOD’s everlasting
arms. Thanks be to his great name, they have upholden me for some
weeks last past. I have now been a circuit of several hundred miles.
At _Portsmouth_ and _Gosport_ the word ran and was glorified. In _South
Wales_ every where the fields have been white ready unto harvest. Not
a dog stirs his tongue. Last _Sunday_ I believe I preached to near
twenty thousand souls. Grace! grace! In about ten days I hope to be at
_Bristol_. Soon after I propose to go to _London_, and from thence to
_Yorkshire_ and _Scotland_.――Follow me with your prayers, and in return
you shall be remembered by, very dear Sir,

                       Your affectionate friend,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLXII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. H――――._

                                          _Landovery, June 14, 1749._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

YOURS, dated _May_ 24th, gave me both pleasure and pain. I was pleased
to read the sweet observations made up and down in it, but pained to
find that you have been much indisposed. But what says our LORD? “Those
that abide in him, he will purge;” but it is only in order that they
may bring forth more fruit. Perhaps our LORD is about to employ you
in some fresh work. I wish you may be enabled to draw your pen on the
topic you mentioned; it may be of great service to the church of CHRIST.
Your remark upon my pamphlet is just. I wrote short, because I know
long compositions generally weary the reader. Perhaps hereafter I may
write more; but at present I find I have enough to do, to travel, and
preach, and answer my correspondents. I published my confession of some
mistakes and imprudencies, to satisfy my own conscience, and stop the
mouths of adversaries, and strengthen the hands of real disinterested
hearty friends: but where are such friends to be found? That phantom
called _Contempt_ keeps them in fetters, and makes them afraid
to appear in defence of a cause, which, (notwithstanding the many
imprudencies that have attended it) is undoubtedly the cause of GOD.
If we think to be free from these, in this imperfect state of things,
and to see either a perfect saint or a perfect church till we come to
heaven, we shall find ourselves much mistaken. Daily experience, and
more mature consideration, may lessen our blunders and imperfections;
but death alone will put a final stop to their mixing in all we do.
Thanks be to GOD that we have a CHRIST, who amidst all does love,
and can uphold us. If our infirmities lead us to his cross, and our
sufferings only make us more willing to be conformed to him in his
death, we are gainers by all our losses, and rise by all our falls.
Blessed be the LORD, that you, dear Sir, have had grace given you to
sit down and count the cost. I wish the beloved physician was more
reconciled to the cross. I am persuaded, let him say what he pleases,
that a too great attachment to the world makes him reason as he does
in many things. Well,――he is in good hands. He must either come or be
dragged to the cross. That pretty character of his must be crucified
and slain: and as well as others, he must be content (as Mr. _Gurnall_
expresses it) “to go to heaven in a fool’s coat.” O my dear Sir, what
pains is the LORD JESUS obliged to take with us, before we can be
reconciled to suffer shame for his great name’s sake!


                                                  _Bristol, June 24._

Thus far I wrote, but was obliged to stop, being called out to preach.
Yesterday GOD brought me here, after having carried me a circuit of
about eight hundred miles, and enabled me to preach, I suppose to
upwards of a hundred thousand souls. I have been in eight _Welch_
counties, and I think we have not had one dry meeting. The work in
_Wales_ is much upon the advance, and likely to increase daily. Had
my dear Mr. _H――――_ been there to have seen the simplicity of so many
dear souls, I am persuaded he would have said, “_Sit anima mea cum
Methodistis!_” But every one to his post. During this excursion I have
been kept happy inwardly, and well in body till the latter end of last
week, when the LORD was pleased to lay his hand upon me, so that I was
almost brought to the grave. But he that wounds, heals also. Thanks be
to his holy name for ever and ever! On _Monday_ or _Tuesday_ next, GOD
willing, I set out for _London_. Good Lady _H――――_ is here, and goes on
in her usual way, doing good. She is recovered from her indisposition.
I hope this will find you recovered also. That the LORD of all Lords
may give you a thriving soul in a healthy body, is the hearty prayer of,
reverend and dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCLXIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. P――――._

                                             _London, July 10, 1749._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

YOUR kind letter came safe to hand, and it was the more welcome,
because it gave me a proof of your being recovered from your late
threatening indisposition. Blessed be GOD, it found me as well as can
be expected in my body, and I trust steady in promoting the welfare of
precious and immortal souls. I have lately seen great things in _Wales_,
and the seed sown among the Rich, has in some sprung up and brought
forth fruit; but what you have heard from _Scotland_ is all a mistake.
I heartily wish all was true. The time I hope will come, when princes
shall adorn the Redeemer’s train. Is there no prospect of your coming
over? Your Mr. _T――――_ might do much for _New-Jersey_ college; but I
have told you my mind in a former letter. May GOD direct for the best!
I am looking up, to know what the great Head of the church would have
me to do. I have a great mind to return to my beloved _America_ this
fall, but am not yet determined. My wife arrived about a fortnight
ago, and joins in sending cordial salutations to all. O that we may all
increase with all the increase of GOD! Your sentiments concerning Mr.
_H――――_’s book, are very just. It has gone through six editions. The
author of it is my old friend; a most heavenly-minded creature, one of
the first of the Methodists, who is contented with a small cure, and
gives all that he has to the poor. He is very weak, and daily waits
for his dissolution. A neighbouring clergyman near him preaches the
gospel; and a physician, formerly a noted Deist, has lately espoused
the interest of JESUS of _Nazareth_. We correspond with, though we
cannot see one another. We shall ere long meet in heaven:

              _There pain, and sin, and sorrow cease,_
              _And all is calm, and joy, and peace._

I recommend myself most earnestly to your prayers, and am, reverend and
dear Sir,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLXIV.


                         _To Mr. J―――― D――――._

                                             _London, July 12, 1749._

_My dear Friend_,

I Am obliged to you for your kind letters; for the trouble you have
been at about the money, and for all favours. Was I to follow my
own inclinations, I would come and thank you in person; but I fear
providence will not permit me to embark for _America_ this fall.
However, I am looking up, and looking about me, and trust our LORD
will point out his way before me. I am not at all uneasy at what one of
your clergy may have said of me; I am only sorry upon his own account;
having known more than once, that GOD delights to plead the cause
of the injured. I trust I can say, that with simplicity and godly
sincerity I desire to have my conversation in the world; and I hope
it is my daily study to keep a conscience void of offence towards GOD
and towards man. Whilst this is the case, we need not fear what men or
devils can say, or do unto us. They can only speak all manner of evil
against us falsely: and that our LORD hath taught us to expect. They
can only kill the body; blessed be GOD, the soul is out of their reach.
I am content to wait till the day of judgment for the clearing up
of my character: and after I am dead, I desire no other epitaph than
this, “Here lies _G. W._ what sort of a man he was, the great day
will discover.” O my dear Sir, what a blessed thing is it to have the
Redeemer to be our friend. If we can but truly say, “I know that my
Redeemer liveth,” how safely may we put our souls into his hands, as
into the hands of a faithful creator! I hope my dear Mr. _D――――_ will
not rest till he can say so.――The frequent indispositions of body
that you are under, are so many loud calls to prepare for another
world.――Nothing but the righteousness of CHRIST imputed, and the
holiness of CHRIST imparted to your soul, can make you happy in a dying
hour. I could enlarge, but must away. With this, I have sent you a
dozen of my nine sermons, to be disposed of as you think best. I would
send more, but have very few left. I would write to Esquire _R――――_,
and some other gentlemen, but have not the least leisure. Be pleased
to remember me to them in the kindest manner, as they come in your
way, and let them know they are not forgotten by me. Will your dear
yoke-fellow, and all your family, accept of my hearty love? I owe you
much. May the LORD JESUS reward you a thousand-fold! He will, he will.
Last night Capt. _H――――_ did me the pleasure to sup with me. I took
it extremely kind, and should be glad to wait upon _Bermudas_ friends
every day. My wife hath been arrived about a fortnight, and joins in
sending cordial salutations with, my dear Mr. _D――――_,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLXV.


                        _To Lady Fanny S――――._

                                             _Bristol, Aug. 1, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

THOUGH I had the pleasure of hearing of your welfare, by your last to
good Lady _H――――n_, yet I cannot help taking the freedom of sending
your Ladyship a few lines. They come to inform you, that you never are,
and, by divine assistance, never shall be forgotten by me at the throne
of grace. To that, I trust, your Ladyship finds free access every day,
and every hour, through the blood of the Lamb, who was slain to take
away the sins of the world. Your Ladyship’s present situation, I hope,
will be sanctified to this end. It is in the school of affliction
that we must learn the way to, and reap benefit from the cross.――Happy
they who come purified out of the furnace, and, like the burning bush,
flourish unconsumed in fire. This, Madam, is the privilege of all
believers. Trials, which harden others, purify and soften them. The
love of GOD turns every thing into what is more valuable than gold. It
brings light out of darkness, and causes others blindness to increase
our spiritual sight. O glorious privilege! happy change! How much are
you indebted, honoured Madam, to free grace, for making you in any
degree a partaker of it! Alas! alas! but few of your Ladyship’s station
in life choose to strive to enter into that strait gate which leadeth
unto life eternal. The noise of coaches, and the continual attention
to what they call innocent diversions, drowns the small still voice of
GOD’s blessed Spirit speaking in their hearts. Since I have been here,
many in high life have attended; whether to any valuable purpose, the
great day will discover. Good Lady _H――――n_ still continues to abound
in the work of the LORD, and is brightening her crown every day and
hour. She is quite well, and intends staying some days longer for the
benefit of the waters. Your Ladyship is remembered when we are feasting
at the Redeemer’s table. In a few days I shall move hence; and it may
be, that I shall go to _Georgia_ this fall. May the LORD direct me, and
bless all those who are the orphan’s friends! That your Ladyship may be
blessed with all the blessings of the everlasting gospel, is the hearty
prayer of, honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most obliged, obedient humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLXVI.


                            _To Mr. L――――._

                                             _Bristol, Aug. 4, 1749._

_Dear Mr. L――――_,

PROVIDENCE, for wise reasons, prevented my seeing you both at
_Gloucester_, and at the _Hill_. This comforts me, “What is, is
best.” Since I came here, I have seen your letter about the intended
charity-school, and wish you success in the name of the LORD. I
communicated it to our elect lady, who immediately contributed five
guineas, another two, and Colonel _G――――_ one. These I have sent for
you, to Mr. ――――, who, I suppose, will take care to convey them to you.
Mrs. _E――――_, I believe, intends to do something. Mr. _C――――_ likewise
spoke to the Bishop, who, I think, has promised to contribute: so that
you see no time has been lost. Only, my dear friend, take this caution,
“sit down, and count the cost, before you begin to build.” Do not lay
out more than you know you can pay. Go the cheapest way to work; and if
you cannot build, rather keep a stock in hand to pay the schoolmaster,
and hire a house convenient from year to year, and, if possible, find
the children in books. You well know what I have suffered for running
too far into debt for others. I am glad you are likely to settle at
_S――――_. May the LORD JESUS bless you and yours more and more! He
continues to be kind to me, and will at length, I am persuaded, (though
I pass through many tribulations) land me safe in glory. There we shall
meet, never to part again. In the mean while, that we may both behave
like good soldiers of JESUS CHRIST, is the hearty prayer of, my dear
friend,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCLXVII.


                       _To the Bishop of W――――._

                                             _Bristol, Aug. 7, 1749._

_My Lord_,

THE occasion of my troubling your Lordship in this manner, is as
follows. I have, more then once, been very credibly informed, that your
Lordship has been pleased to charge me, at the public Wells, with being
guilty of _Perjury_. This comes, therefore, to beg the favour of your
Lordship, only to let me know, (in whatever manner your Lordship shall
judge most proper) upon what foundation such a charge is built: and I
hereby promise, by divine assistance, that a full, fair, and explicit
answer shall be given to your Lordship, by, my Lord,

               Your Lordship’s dutiful son and servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCLXVIII.


                       _To the Bishop of W――――._

                                             _Bristol, Aug. 7, 1749._

_My Lord_,

I Thank your Lordship for your kind and cordial letter. I shall take
care to do your Lordship justice, by shewing it to such persons as I
think have been more immediately concerned. This, I imagine, will be as
much satisfaction as your Lordship will desire. I suppose the mistake
has lain here: your Lordship might have insinuated, that by my present
way of acting, I had broken the solemn engagement I had entered into at
my ordination: and that might have been interpreted to imply a charge
of _Perjury_. The relation in which I stand to the Right Honourable
the Countess of _H――――_, made me desirous to clear myself from such an
imputation; and at the same time to give your Lordship an opportunity
of vindicating yourself in the manner you have done. Was I not afraid
of intruding too much upon your Lordship’s time, and of shewing the
least inclination to controversy, I would endeavour, in the fear of GOD,
to answer the other part of your Lordship’s letter; and, as far as lies
in me, give your Lordship a satisfactory account of whatever may seem
irregular and exceptionable in my present conduct. This I would be glad
to do, not only before your Lordship, but all the Right Reverend the
Bishops; for I highly honour them on account of the sacred character
they sustain, and would make it my daily endeavour to obey all their
godly admonitions. This, I presume, my Lord, is the utmost extent of
the promise I made at my ordination. If I err or deviate from this, in
any respect, it is through ignorance and want of better information,
and not (as far as I know my own heart) but of obstinacy or contempt of
lawful authority. But I forget myself. I beg your Lordship’s pardon for
taking up so much of your time; I thank your Lordship for your prayers
in my behalf; and beg leave to offer mine in return for your Lordship’s
present and eternal welfare, who am, my Lord,

       Your Lordship’s dutiful son, and obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLXIX.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                           _Plymouth, Aug. 15, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Hope this will find your Ladyship recovered from the fatigue of
your journey, and sitting under the Redeemer’s shadow with unspeakable
delight at _Ashby-Place_. My prayers have constantly followed you, ever
since I left your Ladyship at _Bristol_; and the LORD of all lords has
dealt bountifully with me in my way _Westward_. At _Wellington_, as
I was riding through the town, a good woman stopped me, and entreated
me to give the people a sermon. I complied, and preached to a great
company; and the next day to a much larger at the same place. I have
also preached once at _Exeter_, twice at _Kingsbridge_, and once here
at _Plymouth_, where, by the providence of an infinitely condescending
GOD, I came yesterday in the afternoon. Several, I find, were awakened
when I was here last; and the fields are every where white, ready unto
harvest. My late pamphlet has been greatly blest. My Lord of _Exeter_
was asked, Whether he had seen it? He answered, “Yes,” and said, “I
wrote like an honest man, had recanted several things, but he goes on
in the same way yet.” Being asked, Whether he did not intend publishing
his second part? he replied, “You may expect a second.” GOD be praised!
I wish it may come out before I embark. I find he did not proceed to
sentence Mr. _T――――_; he only threatened to pull off his gown. Mr.
_T――――_ immediately pulled it off himself, and said, “He could preach
the gospel without a gown,” and went out. Upon which the Bishop sent
after him, and soothed him. In a few days I hope to see Mr. _T――――_,
and then your Ladyship shall have further particulars. Blessed be GOD,
all things turn out for the furtherance of the gospel. “Out of the
eater comes forth meat, and out of the strong comes forth sweetness.”
In about a fortnight I hope to reach _London_, and in the mean time
shall take care to send your Ladyship historical letters. I count it
my highest honour and privilege to wait upon your Ladyship; but I fear
shall never have it in my power to express my gratitude as I ought, for
those unmerited favours your Ladyship hath been pleased to confer on,
honoured Madam,

             Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, though
                  unworthy servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLXX.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                           _Plymouth, Aug. 18, 1749._

_Dear Sir_,

I Thank you for your kind letter, which I have not had an opportunity
of answering until now. I rejoice that so much gospel seed has been
sown in _Yorkshire_, and that so much hath sprung up and brought forth
fruit. No wonder that the enemy has been busy to sow tares of various
kinds amongst it. This always was, and, in all probability, will always
be the case, till time shall be no more. Happy they! who are enabled to
distinguish truth from error, and who, amongst the different sentiments
of CHRIST’s disciples, maintain a catholic love for all. Your letter
bespeaks you to be thus minded. This is what I would aim at, because
it is the glory of a christian, and a temper of mind which sweetly
prepares us for the communion of saints in heaven. Be pleased,
therefore, to give my love to all that love the LORD JESUS in sincerity.
If any of my poor writings have been blessed to any, let CHRIST have
the glory, and me your prayers. I want them much. I am the chief of
sinners, less than the least of all saints; but, I trust, am willing
to spend and be spent for souls. The beginning of next month, I have
thoughts of being your way. If it is best, providence will direct my
course thither. In the mean while, and at all other seasons, whether
I come or not, I recommend myself to your prayers, as being, though
unknown, yet, for JESUS CHRIST’s sake,

                 Your affectionate friend and servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLXXI.


                          _To Captain W――――._

                                           _Plymouth, Aug. 19, 1749._

_My very dear Brother_,

I Do not love to be long out of _Bristol_ without writing to you. I
want to know how it is with you after the loss of my noble patroness,
and whether dear Mr. _H――――_ goes on. I have been preaching as usual in
the _West_, and for some days past have been comforted and refreshed in
a peculiar manner. Last night I heard that the Bishop had published a
second pamphlet, of half-a-crown price, with a preface to me. Have you
seen it, or do you think it worth answering? He told a clergyman some
time ago, that he might expect a second part. He said, “My answer was
honest; that I had recanted many things, but that I went on in my usual
way still.” GOD forbid I should do otherwise. I am informed, that upon
threatening to pull Mr. _T――――_’s gown off, he threw it off himself,
and said, “He could preach the gospel without a gown,” and so withdrew.
Upon which the Bishop sent for him in, and soothed him. Particulars
I expect to hear on _Tuesday_ at _Biddiford_, where I hope to see Mr.
_T――――_; and to-morrow se’nnight, GOD willing, I intend to preach at
_Exeter_, in my way to _London_. I hope you find retirement blessed
to you. Whether retired, or in public life, that you may be entirely
devoted to the most adorable Redeemer, is the hearty prayer of, my very
dear brother,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._


                     POSTSCRIPT to Lady _H――――n_.

_Honoured Madam_,

SINCE I wrote the above, GOD has given me a glorious season at the
dock, where I preached to a great multitude. This morning the King of
kings shewed himself in the gallery of his ordinances indeed; and this
evening I preached to many thousands in _Plymouth_ fields. It was a
solemn meeting. Since that, a youth, laden with a sense of sin, came
crying, “What shall I do to be saved?” May JESUS give him rest! May the
same JESUS still fill your Ladyship with all his fulness! To-morrow,
GOD willing, I set out for _Biddiford_. I have now a clergyman with
me, who is made a rural Dean, and who, I believe, preaches CHRIST in
sincerity.




                           LETTER DCCLXXII.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                          _Biddiford, Aug. 24, 1749._

SINCE I had the honour of writing to your Ladyship, I have seen the
Bishop’s second pamphlet, in which he hath served the Methodists, as
the bishop of _Constance_ served _John Huss_, when they ordered some
painted devils to be put round his head, before they burned him. His
preface to me is most virulent. Every thing I wrote in my answer, is
turned into the vilest ridicule, and nothing will satisfy, but giving
up the glorious work of the ever-blessed GOD, as entirely cheat and
imposture. I cannot see that it calls for any further answer from
me. Mr. _Wesley_, I think, had best attack him now, as he is largely
concerned in this second part. I hope to be in _London_ some time
next week. I think of leaving this place to-morrow, and to preach at
_Exeter_ next Lord’s-day. The glorious _Emmanuel_ has given me several
spiritual children in this place, who do indeed adorn the gospel of
GOD their Saviour. Here is a little flock, to whom, I believe, it will
be our heavenly Father’s good pleasure to give an eternal kingdom.
I have preached once publicly to a large auditory, and this evening
am to preach again. I am ashamed I do no more for Him, who hath done
and suffered so much for me. O what shall I render unto the LORD of
all lords, whose mercy endureth for ever! A thought of his infinite
patience and long-suffering strikes me dumb. His goodness, in bringing
me into the acquaintance of your Ladyship, quite amazes me; and
the many peculiar providences that have attended me this last year,
encourage me to believe that goodness and mercy shall follow me all the
days of my life, and that I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for
ever. There, shall I see your Ladyship; and will there thank you before
men and angels for all you have done for unworthy me, and that blessed
cause in which I am embarked. That your Ladyship in the mean while may
be watered every moment by the dew of the Redeemer’s heavenly blessing,
is and shall be the continued prayer of, honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, though unworthy
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCLXXIII.


                      _To the Countess of D――――._

                                          _Biddiford, Aug. 24, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

AS I am always praying for, so I cannot help sometimes writing to your
Ladyship. I think I can say, “The love of CHRIST constrains me.” Thanks
be to GOD that your Ladyship knows what these words mean. I hope you
find it every day constraining you more and more to every good word
and work. My greatest pain is, to find that I can do no more for Him,
who has done and suffered so much for me. Blessed be his name, that the
fields are yet every where white, ready unto harvest. Since I have been
in the _West_, I have been preaching as usual, and a divine influence
hath every where attended the word. This, I think, is the best way
to answer those that oppose themselves. If GOD be for us, who can be
against us? I suppose your Ladyship hath seen the Bishop’s second
pamphlet. Surely it is an original. May the LORD JESUS open his eyes,
and change his heart! Well might the glorious _Emmanuel_ break out into
this blessed exclamation, “I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good
in thy sight.” Honoured Madam, how much are you indebted to divine
grace, that hath singled you out from among the Mighty and Noble,
and placed your Ladyship to the number of those happy few to whom it
is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of GOD! I trust your
honoured sister will ere long bear you company, and travel with you
in that narrow road which leads to eternal life. When I remember
you, I always think of her, and beg my most dutiful respects may find
acceptance with her Ladyship. Some time next week I hope to be in town
for a few days, and then shall do myself the honour of calling upon
your Ladyship. In the mean while I recommend you to the tender mercies
of the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS, and beg an interest in your
Ladyship’s prayers, in behalf of, honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most obedient, obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._





                           LETTER DCCLXXIV.


                        _To Lady Fanny S――――._

                                             _Exeter, Aug. 26, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

THOUGH I took the freedom of writing to your Ladyship before I left
_Bristol_, and though I hope to be in town by next _Thursday_ evening,
yet gratitude and respect even compel me to trouble your Ladyship
with another letter from this place. Here I came last night, after
having preached the everlasting gospel to many thousands in the _West_.
Sometimes I have been weak in body; but He, whose I am, and whom I
endeavour to serve in the gospel of his dear Son, hath carried me
through, and greatly refreshed and comforted my soul. Alas! to what a
heaven are they strangers, who deny the influence of the Blessed Spirit,
and cry down the felt and abiding joys of the Holy Ghost, as fancy,
enthusiasm, and delusion. Ye poor dry Rationalists! I honour your
parts in other respects, but pity your ignorance in the things of
GOD. By this time, I suppose your Ladyship hath seen the Bishop’s
second performance. I think it is an original, and so very scurrilous,
unchristian, and profane, that I cannot think it will be worth my
while to answer him again. I have satisfied my conscience in publishing
my last pamphlet; and I now commit our cause to him who judgeth
righteously. O honoured Madam, what a happy thing is it to be despised
for the sake of JESUS! When _John Huss_ was burnt, the Bishop of
_Constance_ painted devils upon paper, and put them round his head;
how soon were they exchanged for a crown of glory! Yet a little while,
and He that cometh will come, and will not tarry. Till then, may your
Ladyship be kept by the mighty power of GOD through faith, and stand
impregnable as a wall of brass! May you be kept a stranger to names and
parties, and by a holy, humble, uniform imitation of the blessed JESUS,
evidence to the world, that you are indeed experimentally acquainted
with the power of his resurrection. High is your station, great are
your difficulties; but he that dwelleth on high is mightier, and hath
engaged to make you more than conqueror through his love. To his tender
mercy do I now, and likewise every day, commend your Ladyship; and this,
by divine assistance, shall always be the employ of, honoured Madam,

         Your Ladyship’s most obedient, obliged, ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLXXV.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                             _London, Sept. 4, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

BY the providence of good and gracious GOD, I came to town on
_Thursday_ evening, after having had a pleasant circuit in the _West_.
The day after I wrote to your Ladyship, I preached twice at _Exeter_,
and in the evening I believe I had near ten thousand hearers. The
Bishop and several of his clergy stood very near me, as I am informed.
A good season it was. All was quiet, and there was a great solemnity in
the congregation; but a drunken man threw at me three great stones. One
of them cut my head deeply, and was like to knock me off the table; but,
blessed be GOD, I was not discomposed at all. One of the other stones
struck a poor man quite down. As I came from _Exeter_, I visited one
_John Hayne_, the soldier that, under GOD, begun the great awakening in
_Flanders_. He is in _Dorchester_ ♦gaol for preaching at _Shaftsbury_,
where there has been, and is now a great awakening. Every where the
work is upon the spread; and since I have been here, we have had some
of the most awful, solemn, powerful meetings, as I ever saw at the
Tabernacle. Congregations have been very large, and I have had several
meetings with the preachers. On _Saturday_ I had the honour of being
almost all the day long with Lady _F――――_, Lady _H――――_, Lady _C――――_,
and the Countess of _D――――_. Lady _F――――_ and the Countess received the
blessed sacrament before the others came: and I think they both grow.
If I stay over _Sunday_, (as perhaps I may) I hope to have another day
with them. I am sorry to inform your Ladyship, Mr. _D――――_ died last
_Sunday_ about noon. He had been sick about a fortnight, was in doubts
for a while, but two or three days before his death he rejoiced in
GOD his Saviour. This morning I had the pleasure of a visit from Mr.
_P――――_ and two _German_ ministers, who have been labouring among the
_Jews_, and been made instrumental of converting many of them. They
seemed to be dear souls. They have preached at the _German_ chapel with
great power. That your Ladyship may always enjoy a thriving soul in a
healthy body, is the continual prayer of, honoured Madam,

                   Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                           LETTER DCCLXXVI.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                       _Oundle, in Northamptonshire, Sept. 15, 1749._

_My very dear Mr. B――――_,

THOUGH I have not written to you, yet I know of no one in _America_,
for whom I have a more real and abiding esteem. The account of your
temporal affairs, which I received from my wife, gave me great concern.
I often wish it was in my power to assist you; but as it is not, all
I can do is to pray for you, and exhort you to look up to Him, who
has engaged, that all things shall work together for good to those who
love him in sincerity. This, I am persuaded, may be said of you; and
therefore, dear Sir, be of good courage. These light afflictions are
but for a moment, and are intended to work out a far more exceeding
and eternal weight of glory. Thanks be to GOD, all the hell we are to
have, is on this side the grave; there is none for believers beyond
it: and even in the midst of our deepest temporal misery, we may enjoy
an antepast of heaven. This you know by experience. Thanks be to GOD
for this unspeakable gift in and through CHRIST JESUS our LORD. Though
faint, my dear friend, yet still pursue. Yonder stands the blessed
JESUS with a crown in his hand, ready to put on the conqueror’s head.
Let this animate you, for you shall certainly reap in due time, if you
faint not. I could write much, but am surrounded with business from
many quarters. Blessed be GOD, my hands are full of work, though I
stand amazed that the Redeemer does not lay me aside. But his grace
is free. I commend you and your dear yoke-fellow to his never failing
mercy, and begging a continued interest in your prayers, subscribe
myself, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCLXXVII.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. H――――._

                                        _Binnington, Sept. 17, 1749._

_Rev. and very dear Sir_,

IF you was uneasy that my last lay by you unanswered, I am sure I have
been, it may be, much more so, ever since yours came to hand. Upon
reading it, I felt all the springs of sympathy move as it were at
once. Glad would I have been of the wings of a dove, to have fled to,
and condoled with my suffering friend. Perhaps I have heard from what
corner your cross comes. It is a very near one indeed.――A saying of Mr.
_B――――_ hath often comforted me; “I would often have nestled, but GOD
always put a thorn in my nest.” Is not this suffered, my dear brother,
think you, to prick you out, and to compel you as it were to appear
for the LORD JESUS CHRIST? Preaching is my grand _Catholicon_ under all
domestic, as well as other trials. Methinks the voice of providence now
is, “Who is on the LORD’s side?”――I fear Dr. _S――――_ has done you hurt,
and kept you in shackles too, too long. For CHRIST’s sake, my dear Mr.
_H――――_, exhort him, now he hath taken the gown, to play the man, and
let the world see that not worldly motives, but GOD’s glory and a love
for souls, have sent him into the ministry. Though when I conversed
with him he was exceeding weak, yet as I trust there is sincerity at
the bottom, I hope he will turn out a flamer at last. O when shall this
once be! who would lose one moment? Amazing! that the followers of a
crucified Redeemer should be afraid of contempt. Surely it must be for
want of looking more to, and considering him who endured so much pain,
and despised so much shame, but is now sitting at the right hand of the
throne of GOD. _O gloriam quantam et qualem!_ Rise, _H――――_, rise, and
see thy JESUS reaching out a crown with this motto, _Vincenti dabo_.
Excuse this freedom, I write out of the fulness of my heart, not to
draw you over to me or a party, but to excite you to appear openly for
GOD. I am glad you intend to write. May I know the plan you intend to
go upon? Do you think to say any thing to the Bishop of _Exeter_? Have
you seen his second piece? Would you have me reply? Will you point out
to me the faults of my first answer? A letter may be directed (if you
write immediately) to be left for me at the Reverend Mr. _J――――_’s,
_Yorkshire_. Thither I am bound now, and if the season of the year
should permit, I would stretch to _Scotland_. Alas, how soon is the
year gone round since I was there last! and how little have I done for
JESUS! A thought of it sometimes breaks my heart. And yet how good is
the LORD! In _London_ we have had most delightful seasons. The glory
of the Redeemer filled the tabernacle. If any doubt whether the cause
we are embarked in be the cause of GOD, I say, “Come and see.” Are you
free that I should call upon you in my return to town? I think to come
by way of _Northampton_. You shall hear what is done in _Yorkshire_.
I find GOD has blessed my preaching at _Oundle_ to some souls. At
_Biddiford_, _Plymouth_, _Exeter_, and _Chatham_ the word ran and was
glorified. But what am I doing? I never wrote to any one so freely, I
think, that I was not personally acquainted with, as to you. Pardon me,
if I am too free, and impute it to the love that is borne you by,
reverend and dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCLXXVIII.

                                         _Newcastle, Sept. 29, 1749._

_My very dear Brother_,

SINCE I wrote to you last, I have had many proofs that GOD’s providence
directed my way into _Yorkshire_. I preached four times at _Abberford_,
four times at _Leeds_, and thrice at _Howarth_, where lives one Mr.
_G――――_. At his church I believe we had above a thousand communicants,
and in the church-yard about six thousand hearers. It was a great
day of the son of man. At _Leeds_ the auditory consisted of above ten
thousand. About _Leeds_ are Mr. _W――――_’s societies. I was invited
thither by them and one of their preachers; and Mr. _Charles W――――_
coming thither published me himself. I therefore complied, and I
believe the gospel was welcome. I have preached here once, and am
to preach again this evening. On _Monday_, GOD willing, I propose to
return to _Yorkshire_, and from thence to _London_. Pray send me word
immediately whether the _Port-Merchant_ be gone, because I know not
but some out of _Wales_ may go in her. I forgot to tell you in my last,
that I had given over the immediate care of all my societies to Mr.
_H――――_; so that now I am a preacher at large indeed. I find every
thing is turning round strangely. O for simplicity and honesty to the
end! I long to know how it is with you. Am I to have my brother at
last? Do convictions fasten, and can you at length sing,

                _Be gone, vain world; my heart resign,_
                _For I must be no longer thine?_

For the present, adieu. My love to all. I wish you the very best of
blessings, and am, my very dear brother,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCLXXIX.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                           _Newcastle, Oct. 1, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Wrote to your Ladyship lately a few lines under great weariness of
body. I then promised to send your Ladyship many pleasing particulars.
Till now I have not had opportunity; and now what shall I say to your
Ladyship? Never did I see more of the hand of GOD in any of my journies
than in this. At Mr. _G――――_’s I believe there were above six thousand
hearers. The sacramental occasion was most awful. At _Leeds_ the
congregation consisted of above 10,000. In the morning at five I was
obliged to preach out of doors. I was invited to _Leeds_ by one of Mr.
_W――――_’s preachers, and by all his people. The gospel was welcome to
them. In my way hither I met Mr. _Charles W――――_, who returned back
with, and introduced me to the pulpit in _Newcastle_. As I am a debtor
to all, and intend to be at the head of no party, I thought it my
duty to comply. I have preached now in their room four times, and this
morning I preached to many thousands in a large close. This evening I
am to do the same again. The power of GOD has attended his own word,
and there seems to be a quickening and stirring among the souls. To-
morrow, GOD willing, we set out for _Leeds_, and after about a week’s
stay in those parts I intend returning to _London_. As it is so late
in the year, my _Scotch_ friends advise me to defer my going thither.
Had I known that, I should have embarked for _America_ this fall; but
I find there were other reasons for my being prevented crossing the
waters this winter. I desire to follow the Lamb whithersoever he is
pleased to lead me. At _New-haven_ there is a great awakening. If any
thing offers worthy of notice, your Ladyship shall be sure to hear.
In the mean while, I continue to put up my usual prayer, that your
Ladyship may be filled with all the fulness of GOD, and to subscribe
myself, honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most obliged and willing servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCLXXX.


                        _To Lady Fanny S――――._

                                           _Newcastle, Oct. 1, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

SOME time last week, my wife sent me the letter your Ladyship was
pleased to favour me with about three weeks ago. Though I was sorry
it did not reach me before I left town, yet I rejoiced to find that it
bespoke your Ladyship’s attachment to the ever-loving ever-lovely JESUS,
and a desire to partake of the sacred symbols of his most blessed body
and blood. I doubt not but your Ladyship, with full purpose of heart,
will cleave unto him, and in spite of men and devils go on in that
narrow way which leads to life eternal. GOD’s grace will be sufficient
for you. He hath promised, and he is faithful who hath promised, never
to leave nor forsake those that put their trust in him. He is in the
burning bush, he is in the fiery furnace. He can and will make us more
than conquerors over all. With what courage then may your Ladyship
go on through this howling wilderness, whilst leaning on your beloved
Saviour? In him alone is all your strength found. Honoured Madam, look
to him, consider him, and thereby you will be kept from being weary
and faint in your mind. I doubt not but you meet with daily crosses.
Persons that stand alone, and in high places, must expect storms. But
JESUS is able and willing to uphold you. Thanks be to his great name
for giving your Ladyship such a share of prudence and courage. May the
glorious _Emmanuel_ increase both; and without being attached to any
party, may you be preserved unspotted from the world, and be a common
friend to all!――Since I saw your Ladyship, I have disengaged myself
from the immediate care of the societies, and am now still more at
liberty to preach the gospel of the blessed GOD. A series of unforeseen
providences brought me down this way. In _Yorkshire_ many, many
thousands have attended the word, and here at _Newcastle_ thousands
also hear the gospel gladly. To-morrow I am returning back, and hope
to be in town some time this month. I fear it is now too late to embark
for _America_ this winter; but, thanks be to GOD, I hear my family
is well, and that the LORD hath given them a plentiful crop. If your
Ladyship lives, I believe you will hear of some souls being educated
at _Georgia_ for GOD. Honoured Madam, my heart’s desire and constant
prayer is, that you may go on from strength to strength, and be
continually growing in the knowledge of yourself and CHRIST JESUS
your LORD. I must now add no more, but my repeated thanks for all your
Ladyship’s favours, and my repeated assurances of being, honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most obliged, obedient, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                              _Estwood in Lancashire, Oct. 25, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

SINCE I had the honour of writing to your Ladyship from _Newcastle_,
fresh wonders of grace and mercy have been shewn us daily. I have
now I think preached about thirty times in _Yorkshire_, and above ten
times in _Cheshire_, and _Lancashire_. Congregations have been very
large, and a solid, convincing, and comforting influence hath every
where attended the word. In one or two places I have had a little
rough treatment, but elsewhere all has been quiet, and many I hear are
brought under concern about the welfare of their better part. At the
importunity of many, I am now returning from _Manchester_ (where I
preached to many thousands) to _Leeds_; from thence I purpose going to
_Sheffield_, and next week I hope to see good Lady _H――――n_ at _Ashby_,
and the week following I hope to be in _London_. Thus do I lead a
pilgrim life: GOD give me a pilgrim heart, and enable me to speak
of redeeming love to a lost world, till I can speak no more! Surely
this is a work that brings with it its own reward. It brings a heaven
into the soul, and causes it, amidst all the scoffs and tauntings
of a benighted, ill-natured, and ridiculing world, to rejoice with
joy unspeakable, even a joy that is full of glory. “To me, (says the
blessed apostle) to live is CHRIST.” When a person can once say so in
reality, then he begins to live indeed. Even death itself is then life,
because death to such a one is eternal gain. O how great, how striking,
how transporting and transforming are the invisible realities of
another world, to a soul that is born of GOD! What meer shadows and
empty nothings are all sublunary enjoyments, when compared with these!
Thanks be to GOD, who has given you, honoured Madam, a taste of these
infinitely important things. My constant prayer for your Ladyship is,
that you may hold on, and hold out, and with full purpose of heart
cleave unto that Redeemer who hath loved you, and given himself for
you. Mrs. _G――――_ at _Manchester_ goes on well, and is not ashamed to
confess him, who I trust has called her out of darkness, and made her
partaker of his marvellous light. May the glorious _Emmanuel_ add daily
to the number of his honourable confessors, and give the rich to know,
that to be rich in faith and good works is the only way to be rich
indeed! All is ours, if we can truly say, we are CHRIST ’s. Honoured
Madam, I must beg your excuse for this freedom; but at present I have
a view of the Redeemer’s glory, and therefore know not well how to stop
when writing of him. Your Ladyship will ♦pardon me, and accept these
poor lines, which shall be followed with hearty prayers from, honoured
Madam,

_Honoured Madam_,

THOUGH I am jealous of myself, lest I should make too free with persons
in high life, yet when I have good news to send concerning the kingdom
of JESUS CHRIST, I am constrained as it were to write to your Ladyship.
Will it not rejoice you very much, honoured Madam, to hear the glorious
_Emmanuel_ is riding on in the chariot of his gospel, from conquering
to conquer? Every day people flock to hear the word, like doves to
their windows. I have preached about thirty times in _Yorkshire_, and
at the desire of many am returned thither again. The latter end of
next week I hope to see good Lady _H――――n_. I suppose her Ladyship will
detain me a few days at _Ashby_, and then I purpose coming directly to
_London_. Thanks be to GOD, all places are near alike to me, so that
I can but be doing something for Him, who hath done and suffered so
much for me. This I would have to be my meat and my drink. To me to
live, let it be CHRIST; for life is no further desirable than as we can
improve it to the promoting his glory. _Mary_ thought so, who in the
days of his flesh sat at the Redeemer’s feet and heard his words. This
I believe is your Ladyship’s daily employ; a glorious employ indeed.
How sweet must his fruit be unto your Ladyship’s taste! Surely it is
sweeter than the honey or the honeycomb. And if the first-fruits are so
delightful, how infinitely delightful must the full harvest be! Go on,
honoured Madam, and whatever others may do, still keep pursuing after
more and more of that better part, which shall never be taken away from
you. JESUS is full of grace, and full of truth. Believers are welcome
to him every moment. He is ready to water them continually with the
dew of his heavenly blessing. It is our privilege to go on from grace
to grace, till grace be swallowed up in endless glory. O that your
honoured sister may march on with your Ladyship towards this blessed
state! There she will have a house, not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens. I send her Ladyship my most dutiful respects, and sincerely
pray that she may be filled with all the fulness of GOD.――I hope
your Ladyship is inclined to remember me at the throne of grace, your
Ladyship knows my name, “The chief of sinners, less than the least of
all saints;” but, for CHRIST’s sake, honoured Madam,

               Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged and
                           willing servant,
                                                              _G. W._

_Honoured Madam_,

ON _Saturday_ evening I had the honour of your Ladyship’s letter,
and as it came before the _Manchester_ post went out, I immediately
sent the inclosed to Mrs. _G――――_. If possible I am persuaded she will
comply. She seems to be quite in earnest. I conversed for about two
hours with the Captain and some other officers, upon the nature and
necessity of the new birth. He was affected, and I hope it was blessed.
Since I left them, I have preached to many thousands at _Rosindale_,
_Aywood_, and _Halifax_. I have also offered JESUS at _♦Burstall_,
_Pudsy_, and _Armly_, and have had three precious seasons here.
Congregations are exceeding large indeed, and both the established
and dissenting clergy are very angry. They thundered I hear yesterday
heartily. But truth is great, and will prevail, though preached in
the fields and streets. Indeed it begins to be cold abroad now; but
the LORD JESUS is pleased to strengthen me, and people flock from all
quarters. This day sevennight, GOD willing, without fail your Ladyship
may depend on seeing me. I thought to have been at _Ashby_ next
LORD’s-day, but a door seems to be opened at _Nottingham_, and I
have thoughts of trying what can be done there. This morning I shall
set out for _Sheffield_. May the LORD give me a pilgrim heart for my
pilgrim life, and then all will be well! I know I have your Ladyship’s
prayers.――I think your Ladyship judges right in respect to the churches.
I expect to meet with many rebuffs, but by the help of my GOD I shall
leap over every wall. That your Ladyship may stand as a wall of brass,
is the hearty prayer of, honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful obedient servant,
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

I Thank you heartily for your kind letter to me, and your kind
benefaction to poor Mr. _C――――_. That GOD, whom you both serve, will
plentifully reward and bless you. I am in great hopes, enough will
be raised to pay his debts, and that a provision will be made for his
future subsistence. Rather than _Elijahs_ shall want, ravens shall
be sent to feed them. Your present circumstances almost distress me,
and at the same time make me ashamed. I think it requires more grace
heartily to say, “Father, thy will be done,” in such a situation, than
to die a martyr forty times. But my dear friend, though your body is
weak and confined at home, your pen hath been active, and your works
walk abroad. I hear of them from all quarters. GOD hath blessed, and
will bless them. Let that comfort you, and if health any way permits,
pray write again. Fear not, my dear dear Man; let faith and patience
hold out a little longer, and then the struggle shall be over. Yet a
little while, and you shall join with that sweet singer Dr. _Watts_,
who whilst on earth dragged a crazy load along, as well as you, for
many years. As for my poor tabernacle, I wonder it is not dissolved
every day; but we are immortal till our work is done. Now is my time
for doing; my suffering time may come by and by. O for strength in a
trying hour! Wherefore should we fear? Wherefore should we doubt? He
that hath loved us, will love us to the end. This encourages me to hold
on my way. Blessed be GOD, I have seen great things since I wrote last.
The fields have been more and more white, ready unto harvest. I am now
at _Ashby_ with good Lady _H――――n_. Her Ladyship has a great regard
for you, and begs you would come and stay a week at her house. She will
take great care of you. I think to remove hence on _Monday_, and should
be very glad to see you in my way to _London_. However this be, we
shall meet in heaven. There the wicked heart and wicked world will
cease from troubling, and there the weary will enjoy an uninterrupted
and eternal rest. This morning we have been remembering our blessed
Redeemer’s death, and I was enabled to pray earnestly for my dear Mr.
_H――――_. I beseech the Father of mercies and GOD of all consolations
to excite you to do the same for my dear old friend.

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_Honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship’s letter greatly rejoiced me, and stirred me up to pray
afresh that our blessed LORD would give you to see of the travel of his
soul, in the salvation of many at _Ashby_. I am persuaded your Ladyship
was not sent there for nothing.――But it is always darkest before
break of day. I desire to be thankful that your honoured Sisters are
pleased to approve of me. Thanks be to GOD, I feel myself unworthy; but
unworthy as I am, my poor prayers I trust will reach heaven in their
behalf. This day, both they and your Ladyship were remembered at the
LORD’s table. The Countess, Lady _G――――_ and Lady _F――――_ were there,
and all I think are grown in grace and in the knowledge of our LORD and
Saviour JESUS CHRIST. What encouragement is this for your Ladyship to
go and speak for GOD? All send their best compliments, and Lady _F――――_
desired me to inform your Ladyship, that the man who was sent up has
been taken care of. Blessed be GOD for putting it in your Ladyship’s
power to help the poor sufferers of _Cork_. Last night I received a
letter from Mr. _L――――_, and purpose this night or to-morrow to write
to him about what your Ladyship desires; I think he will be a proper
person. Mr. _W――――_ I believe is at his house. I pity those who have
been persecuted in _Ireland_. The minister being taken so ill near your
Ladyship, was an alarming providence. But who so blind as those that
will not see? GOD honours your Ladyship, in making you instrumental to
own and provide for those, who are cast out for his great name’s sake.
Great shall be your reward in heaven. I hope you and your honoured
sisters will have great comfort in the perseverance of the poor baker.
He is a _Jerusalem_ sinner, a proper object for free grace to fix on. A
woman of fourscore, and a boy about eleven, have been lately awakened,
and it is hoped converted, in _Essex_. May JESUS feed them all with
bread that comes down from heaven! We have blessed seasons here, and
our LORD gives us to see his stately steps. GOD prepare me for a
suffering hour! Mrs. _C――――_ has met with a heavy trial in the death
of her only daughter, aged twenty. I hear she behaves like a christian
under it. Happy they who know that promise belongs to them, “All things
work together for good to those who love GOD.” How easy may _Isaacs_
be given up by them? But I forget I am weary, when writing to your
Ladyship. Pardon my taking up so much of your precious time. I wish
your Ladyship, your honoured Sisters, and children, all the privileges
of the new-born, heaven-born sons of GOD. This is the only return that
can be made both to them and you, by, honoured Madam,

          Your Ladyship’s most obliged, dutiful, and willing
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

_Very dear Sir_,

I Received your kind letter on _Monday_ last, and to shew you how
willing I am to carry on a correspondence, I take the very first
opportunity of answering it. Yours found me just returned out of
_Yorkshire_, _Lancashire_, &c. Since you heard of me last, I have been
at _Sheffield_ and _Nottingham_, and found the fields every where white
ready unto harvest. I believe my particular province is, to go about
and preach the gospel to all. My being obliged to keep up a large
correspondence in _America_, and the necessity I am under of going
thither myself, entirely prevents my taking care of any societies.
Whether it will ever be my lot to come over to _Ireland_, I cannot say.
I have some thought of being there next Spring; but I would not intrude
on any one’s labours. The world is large, and blessed be GOD, there is
a range and work sufficient for all. As for my manner of preaching, I
believe, was you to hear me, you would find it calculated to serve all,
but intended at least to offend none. I profess to be of a catholic
spirit; I am a debtor to all; I have no party to be at the head of,
and through GOD’s grace, I will have none; but as much as in me lies
strengthen the hands of all, of every denomination, that preach JESUS
CHRIST in sincerity. In this spirit I hope my dear Mr. _L――――_ will
find me, should he ever see me in _Ireland_; but whether I shall go
there or to _America_ in the Spring, is not yet determined. Future
things belong to Him whose I am, and whom I desire to serve to my dying
day, in the gospel of his dear Son. I earnestly beg an interest in
your prayers, and in the prayers of all that love the LORD JESUS in
sincerity. Pray how do the poor people at _Cork_? Lady _H――――_ writes
this concerning them. “I hope the poor persecuted people in _Cork_ will
be helped, and I should be glad if you could write in my name to any of
them, and inform them that I would have written myself, but I know not
how to direct. You may give them my kind assurance of serving them upon
any occasion, and a hint that I believe they will meet with no more
of the like rough usage.” Thus far my good Lady. I have informed her
Ladyship, that I should write to you, who I am persuaded will gladly
and in a prudent manner communicate this to all concerned. And now,
my dear Sir, have I not returned you a long letter? I love you, though
I know you not, and the more so because I hear you breathe a catholic
spirit. May the LORD increase it in your and all his children’s hearts!
I must now add no more, but subscribe myself, very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_Very dear Sir_,

FOR some few days I have been returned from my northern rout, in which
the glorious _Emmanuel_ gave me to see new wonders every day. It was
no small concern to me to turn my back on _Scotland_, when so near.
However it hath been greatly over-ruled for good. I have thereby been
called to preach in many fresh places, and, glory be to GOD, I saw
thousands flock to the hearing of the gospel, like doves to the windows.
The generous offer made me by yourself and lady, I took exceeding kind,
and gladly would I have embraced it, but――――Well! what is, is best.
“Father, not my will but thine be done.” Perhaps I may see you in the
Spring; if not, ere long, dear Sir, we shall meet in heaven. My wife
tells me, she answered Lady _I――――_’s letter immediately. In this she
joins, sending most grateful acknowledgments and cordial salutations.
Blessed be GOD, we are both well, and surrounded with mercies on every
side.――Only ungrateful, ill, and hell-deserving I, want a grateful and
an humble heart. I am altogether an unprofitable servant, but our LORD
I trust will purge me, that I may bring forth more fruit: for by this,
and this only, I know our heavenly father is glorified. What I am most
afraid of is, lest I should flag in the latter stages of my road. But
he that hath loved and helped, will, dear Sir, love and help me to the
end. I am persuaded your prayers and the prayers of christian friends
will be very serviceable. O that you may be kept alive and warm in this
cold declining day! Poor _Scotland_, I pity thee! I will pray for thy
prosperity till I can pray no more! Be pleased to present our joint
love and cordial respects to all friends in general, and we entreat
you and yours to accept the same in a most particular manner from, very
dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

                                             _London, Nov. 30, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Think it is now a whole week since I had the honour and pleasure of
writing to your Ladyship, and as your Ladyship was pleased to desire
the prayers of GOD’s people, I read that part of your letter. Thousands
heartily united in singing the following verses for your Ladyship.

              _Gladly we join to pray for those,_
                _Who rich with worldly honour shine;_
              _Yet dare to own a Saviour’s cause,_
                _And in that hated cause to join:_
              _Yes! we would praise Thee that a few_
              _Love Thee, though rich and noble too._

              _Uphold this star in thy right hand,_
                _Crown her endeavours with success;_
              _Among the great ones may she stand,_
                _A witness of thy righteousness!_
              _Till many nobles join thy train,_
              _And triumph in the Lamb that’s slain._

The verses were made by _T―――― G――――_ who is now under my roof. He
has grievously backslidden, but I hope is now returning home to his
heavenly Father. We had an uncommon scene when he first came to me.
I find the LORD will be sanctified in all them that come near him,
and will not suffer those who are concerned in his cause, and with
his people, to continue in sin long undiscerned. O that I may be kept
simple, and honest, and zealous unto the end! Mine eyes wait upon thee,
O LORD, from whence alone cometh my salvation! I find he never fails
those that put their trust in him. Blessed be his name, I have got
sufficient to pay off Mr. _C――――_’s debts.――Poor, yet attempting at
least to make many rich, I would have my motto still. Mr. _L――――_ also
writes word, that the glorious JESUS hath raised sufficient for his
charity school, and that he is much blessed in his labours. The book
that hath been given to me for your Ladyship, I purpose sending next
week, with one or two of the _Sundays Thoughts_ for your Ladyship’s
honoured sisters. Indeed I honour them very much, and pray for them and
all related to your Ladyship very earnestly. I was glad to hear by Mr.
_R――――_ that your Ladyship and all were so well. May you prosper and
be in health both in body and soul! _London_ already begins to disagree
with my outward man, but the LORD’s smiling upon my poor labours
sweetens all. I have begun to preach by six in the morning. We have
large congregations even then. I trust we shall have a warm winter. I
have not been at the other end of the town this week, but I find all
hold on: however a leader is wanting. This honour hath been put on your
Ladyship by the great head of the church. An honour conferred on few,
but an earnest of a distinguished honour to be put on your Ladyship
before men and angels, when time shall be no more. That you may every
day add to the splendor of your future crown, by always abounding in
the work of the LORD, is the fervent prayer of, honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, and obliged, though
                        very unworthy servant,
                                                              _G. W._

                                              _London, Dec. 3, 1749._

_My dear Mr. L――――_,

I Thank you heartily for your kind Letter, and yet more heartily thank
our glorious _Emmanuel_ for succeeding your charity school, and smiling
upon your public administrations. I have sent Lady _H――――n_ an account
of it, and earnestly pray the blessed Redeemer to own and succeed
you evermore. My winter quarters are made very agreeable; but so much
business crouds in upon me, that I have not time to write long letters.
I am looking out for some fresh sermons for you. Mr. _H――――_, with whom
I spent some agreeable hours lately at _Northampton_, would let you
have some, but his are all in short hand. Here is a volume of one Mr.
_H――――_’s lately deceased that I guess will do for you. A friend to-day
promises to send me _Gurnall’s spiritual Armour_, of which I suppose
you will highly approve. I will endeavour to bring or send it to you.
I cannot think of stirring hence till after Christmas, but before
the Winter is over, I shall long for the Spring to come, that I may
enter on a fresh campaign. The encouragement given me this last fall,
gladdens my poor heart, and makes me to long more than ever to spend
and be spent for that JESUS, who hath shed his precious blood for us
upon the cross. I know those last almost parting words of our ascending
LORD, “Feed my lambs, feed my sheep,” will be engraven upon the tables
of your heart. Our obligations to do so, are very great, at least mine
are. O that we may embrace all opportunities of shewing that we love
our LORD more than every created thing. O for simplicity and godly
sincerity unto the end of our race! Yet a little while, and we shall
reach the goal and lay hold on the crown. Yonder our LORD stands
holding it out. It has those words written upon it, _Vincenti dabo_.
What is infinitely more, he will give us himself. We shall behold, we
shall partake of his glory. _O gloriam ♦quantum et qualem!_ You will
urge all to press after it. Blessed be GOD, that you have so many
around you that have a taste thereof. My hearty love attends them all.
May the LORD JESUS be with your spirit, and give you to increase with
all the increase of GOD! Nothing greater can be, nothing less shall be
desired in your behalf by, my dear old friend,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Madam_,

I Thank you heartily for the acceptable favour of your letter, which
came to my hand last night. It was quite welcome, as it bespoke the
language of a heart panting after GOD, and desirous to be conformed to
its great exemplar the blessed and holy JESUS. Go on, dear Madam, in
his strength, who hath loved you and given himself for you. Confess him
before men, and he will confess you before his holy angels in heaven.
I am glad that Lady _H――――_ visits you often. Whenever you meet, may
the glorious _Emmanuel_ cause your hearts to burn within you. What
you propose for the poor cast-out clergyman, will be accepted of and
rewarded by our common LORD, as done to himself. GOD willing, I purpose
waiting upon you next _Saturday_ by eleven o’clock, and then I can
receive your kind benefaction. _Colonel G――――_ being with me when your
letter came, offered to accompany me. Perhaps Mr. _C――――_ will come
too. I shall see him this day, and shall be sure to inform him and his
wife of what you desire. Good Lady _H――――n_ would gladly make one in
addressing the throne of grace. But she is happy in yonder dead place,
and _Dorcas_-like is always employed for the poor. Glorious privilege!
Blessed redemption! JESUS can make us happy any where and every
where. You have a neighbour that dearly loves him. I mean the reverend
Mr. _Z――――_, the king’s _German_ chaplain. I believe, Madam, he
would be glad to wait upon you; he has now three ministers with him,
burning with the love of CHRIST, and going to preach the gospel in the
_East-Indies_. Have you seen a little piece entitled _Sunday Thoughts_?
I think you would like it much. But I forget myself. I wish you the
best of blessings, all the blessings of the everlasting covenant, and
beg leave to subscribe myself, dear Madam,

        Your most obliged and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXCI.


                         _To Mr. W―――― L――――._

                                              _London, Dec. 9, 1749._

_My dear Mr. L――――_,

I Find by your last kind letter that the king’s business requires haste.
I therefore immediately dispatched it to good Lady _H――――_, who I am
persuaded will think it her highest privilege to serve the dear people
of _Cork_. Whether your account of their sufferings has reached her
Ladyship I cannot tell, but you will know soon. However this we know,
that they have reached the ears of the blessed JESUS, who sitteth in
heaven, and laughs all his enemies to scorn. He will take care that
the bush, though burning, shall not be consumed, nay he will take
care that it shall flourish even when in the midst of fire. In all our
afflictions he is afflicted, and though the under shepherds be smitten,
and his poor sheep for a while scattered, yet even this scattering
shall be over-ruled for the propagation of the glorious gospel. It
will be melancholy to have any preachers transported; but really the
thoughts do not affect me so much, because I know what a field of
action there is for them abroad. It has been my settled opinion for a
long time, that CHRIST’s labourers (at least some of them,) love home
too much, and do not care enough for those thousands of precious souls,
that are ready to perish for lack of knowledge in yonder wilderness. We
propose having an academy or college at the Orphan-house in _Georgia_.
Supposing the worst, hundreds may find a sweet retreat there. The house
is large; it will hold an hundred. I trust my heart is larger, and will
hold ten thousand. Be who or what they will, if they belong to JESUS,
the language of my heart shall be, “Come in, ye blessed of the LORD.”
But perhaps this may not be the issue. The threatning storm may blow
over, and all may be at peace again. It is always darkest before break
of day. May the glorious _Emmanuel_ lighten the darkness of our minds!
then we need not fear what men or devils can say of, or do unto us.
Adored be his free grace for enabling you, dear Sir, to confess him
before men, and to make _Moses_’s choice your choice. Great shall be
your reward of grace, though not of debt: he will confess you before
his Father and his holy angels in heaven. When you write, be pleased
to salute the dear confessors at _Cork_. I love them in the bowels of
JESUS CHRIST, and pray the LORD of all lords to give them grace to quit
themselves like men, and be strong. If any of my poor writings might be
useful, I will send some to _Ireland_ at any time. O free grace, that
the adorable JESUS should ever make use of such a wretch as I am! This
is free grace indeed. Help me, dear Sir, to adore it; and if at any
time I can be serviceable, make no apologies, but write frequently, and
command as well as pray for, my dear friend,

         Your very affectionate brother and chearful servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXCII.


                            _To Mr. G――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 12, 1749._

_My dear Mr. G――――_,

I Thank you for your kind letter. It bespoke the language of an honest
heart. If I am not mistaken, your name is _Nathaniel_. This is what
I fain would be, an _Israelite_ indeed, in whom is no allowed guile.
Such will JESUS guide in his way. I therefore have no doubt of your
receiving a blessing, a blessing, in what you intend doing next
_Christmas_. You have openly called JESUS and his disciples to the
marriage: and such proceedings are always owned of GOD, whilst contrary
methods are as surely either blasted or embittered by him, who loves
a single eye and an upright heart. You will remember me kindly to Mrs.
_H――――_, and all that love the blessed JESUS in sincerity. I desire
to be thankful for the favour that was left behind a preached gospel.
It is the LORD’s doings. Let us continue praying, and we shall yet
see far greater things than these. You do well to meet at _Rotheram_.
My cordial salutations, attend Mr. _C――――_, Mr. _H――――_, and their
respective families. May the LORD bless them, as he did the house of
_Obededom_, for the ark’s sake! My advice is, quit yourselves like
men, and be strong. If our LORD shall open a door, I fully purpose to
have another stroke at Satan’s strong-holds in _R――――_. JESUS can and
will make us more than conquerors over all. Blessed be his name for
leading you, my dear friend, more and more into the knowledge of his
divine, compleat, and everlasting righteousness. That is a rock against
which the gates of hell shall never prevail. If we have a mind to go
pleasantly to _Canaan_, we must lean, not on our frames, not on a stock
received, but on our Beloved. Looking to him is the only way of being
saved from every evil that annoys and disturbs us. It is his blood,
sprinkled by the blessed Spirit upon the conscience, and that alone,
which cleanseth from all sin. Whatever, therefore, you want, go to
JESUS: that is his name. And why? Because he is to save his people
from their sins. And what amazing grace is it, that we should be in
the number of his people? Surely that GOD-exalting, that self-abasing
expression, “Why me, LORD, why me?” should always be in the mouth of
one redeemed of the Lamb. But I must stop, though with regret. Whilst I
am writing the fire kindles. I beg all your prayers;――no one wants them
more. My wife returns her love. I believe good Lady _H――――_ hath no
place suitable for the person you mention. Why should she fly from her
cross? Sometimes we do best when surrounded by enemies: they keep us
upon our watch. JESUS is able to preserve us, though in a burning bush.
To his never-failing mercy do I commend you all, and am, dear Sir,

            Your affectionate friend and ready servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXCIII.


                            _To Mr. H――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 13, 1749._

_My dear Mr. H――――_,

YOUR kind letter almost made me to blush. I little thought, when I left
_N――――_, that you should have written first; but I have been so engaged
since I came to town, that I could not well write to you before now.
However, you have generally been in my thoughts; and I have not failed
to remember you before him, who is able to save to the uttermost all
that come to the Father in and through him. I see you are still under
the rod, and I trust are enabled to kiss the hand that holds it. These
afflictions, at present are not joyous, but grievous; nevertheless,
through these many tribulations, we shall at length enter into eternal
glory. By doing, or suffering, or by both, our active and passive
graces must be kept in continual exercise. Your sufferings are of a
peculiar nature; peculiar grace shall be given under, and a peculiar
conquest granted over them. Look, my dear Sir, not to the _Mysticks_,
but to JESUS. Indeed, his righteousness is the only rock on which you
can build any solid comfort. In this, and in this only are you compleat.
This is the only breast-plate; and faith in this, a true, living,
operative faith in this, is the only shield whereby the believer will
be enabled to repel all the fiery darts of the wicked one. Thanks be to
GOD, who hitherto hath given you to triumph, hath raised you from a bed
of sickness, and set you on a throne, I mean your pulpit again. May the
glorious _Emmanuel_ enable you to speak from thence both to him and his
people, as becometh the lively oracles of GOD. I find Satan does all
that he can to prevent your using your pen. The LORD will rebuke him
in due time, and cause it yet to become the pen of a ready writer. I
am glad you have opened a correspondence with our elect Lady. Keep it
open I entreat you, my dear friend, and be not _nimis nullus_. Alas!
if differences of every kind were to hinder any one, surely I must be
the man. But in JESUS is my strength found; and as my day is, so he
causes my strength to be. Thanks be to his holy name, we have seen his
outgoings frequently of late in _London_. His glory hath filled the
Tabernacle, and many have been brought under fresh concern for their
souls. I shall be glad to hear that Dr. _S――――_ hath begun to speak
for the LORD. But what can be done, till we are delivered from worldly
hopes and worldly fears? Perfect, unfeigned love to the blessed JESUS,
can only expel these. That your dear soul may constantly overflow with
it, and that you may increase with all the increase of GOD, is the
earnest prayer of, my very dear Mr. _H――――_,

          Your most affectionate, though unworthy friend, and
               brother, and servant in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXCIV.


                         _To Mr. James B――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 14, 1749._

_My dear Friend_,

IF you was rejoiced in hearing from me, I can assure you, I was
delighted, when I received letters from my dear _Maryland_ and
_Bohemia_ friends. Upon reading them, I hoped that our LORD was purging
you, that you might bring forth more fruit to his glory. I hope you
have found it a sanctifying rod, and that it hath only whipped you so
much nearer to the ever-blessed Lamb of GOD. Now, my dear Sir, now is
the time to shew your gratitude; now is the time to begin steadily to
pursue the one thing needful. What avail the many things of this poor
transitory world, in a sick and dying hour? Alas! they are nothing, and
less than nothing. JESUS alone is all in all. He is the pearl of great
price, which a wise merchant will gladly sell all to purchase. It is
worth all, or worth nothing. O when shall it once be, that the children
of this world shall not be wiser in their generations than the children
of light! I trust my dear Mr. _B――――_ will labour to fulfil this wish,
and with full purpose of heart cleave unto his once dying, but now
risen, ascended, and interceding LORD. When shall I love him more;
when shall unworthy I serve him better? My obligations to do so, are
increasing every moment. This last fall has been a glorious seed-time
indeed. I have been in six or seven _Northern_ counties, and thousands
and ten thousands flocked to hear the word. I am now in my Winter
quarters. Our LORD is pleased to bow the heavens, and come down amongst
his people. His glory fills the Tabernacle, and the shout of a king
is heard in our camp. I wish I could hear of the revival of GOD’s work
among you. Let us pray, and not faint. You know who has commanded us
to let him have no rest till _Jerusalem_ be made a praise through the
earth. Methinks I wish the months may fly away, wherein I am detained
from coming to my dear _America_ again. I entreat you to pray me over,
and then I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of
peace. The glorious JESUS deals bountifully with me here. I am better
in health, than I have been some years.――My wife hath much improved in
hers, since her arrival in her native country. She joins in sending
most affectionate respects. Pray remember us to all in the tenderest,
and most endearing manner; and believe me to be, my very dear Mr.
_B――――_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXCV.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                             _London, Dec. 14, 1749._

_Honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship’s letter gave me uncommon joy. I cannot help being
delighted, when any thing I write gives your Ladyship any peculiar
satisfaction. The inclosed I immediately shewed to Colonel _G――――_,
who was very glad, but is still concerned because he does not hear
from your Ladyship; and on _Saturday_, GOD willing, I shall read it to
Lady _H――――_ and Mrs. _K――――_. At that time, I am to give them the holy
sacrament. Last _Saturday_ I prayed with them; and in conversation,
an aged gentlewoman was struck: I shall see how the physic works next
visit. Thanks be to GOD, the Holy Spirit has not done striving with
sinners. I have had glorious accounts of the success attending the
word in my last _Northern_ circuit. Three or four fresh instances of
conviction and conversion I have heard of here, within these few days.
Whatever seems worthy of your Ladyship’s notice shall be sent. I wish
I knew how a parcel might be best conveyed to your Ladyship. If your
Ladyship remembers, last Winter application was made in behalf of one
_Hill_, a Corporal. O that I could do any thing to express my gratitude
to your Ladyship and honoured sisters. In public and private you have
my prayers, which I trust will enter into the ears of the LORD of
Sabaoth. I think your Ladyship hath great encouragement to go on,
striving to win souls to the blessed JESUS. Mrs. _T――――_ is another
jewel in your Ladyship’s crown. May the glorious _Emmanuel_ add daily
to the number of them! We have golden seasons here. Poor Mr. _H――――_
was quite revived with your Ladyship’s letter. He is under the cross
indeed. I am ashamed to think how little I do or suffer for JESUS
CHRIST. Next _Saturday_ I am thirty-five years old; fy upon me, fy upon
me! I beg the continuance of your Ladyship’s prayers, that I may now
begin in earnest to glorify my blessed Master. Nothing else can satisfy,
honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXCVI.


                       _To the Old Mrs. B――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 14, 1749._

_Dear Madam_,

IF this finds you in the land of the living, or rather this land of
the dying, it comes to assure you that your dear letter and the other
letters received from your dear family, gave me great satisfaction.
Blessed be GOD, even the GOD and Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, for
wounding and healing. This is his way. He wounds, in order to heal,
and in the midst of judgment remembers mercy. Surely he is good in
holding your soul in life, and being so much a staff to you in your old
age. He has been a promise-keeping GOD. He has not forsaken you when
grey-headed, and when your natural strength must necessarily begin to
fail you. Though it is cruel to hope you will be kept out of heaven
so long, yet who knows, but I may see you, dear Madam, on this side
eternity. GOD willing, I purpose to embark some time next year without
fail. The infinitely condescending Redeemer vouchsafes to crown my
labours with great success; but in the midst of all, _America_, dear
_America_, is not forgotten by me. Your family is peculiarly dear. I
look upon you as my mother, and on your children as my brethren and
sisters. I have lately been in _Yorkshire_, where I saw a widow, whose
husband lately died in triumph, and who has five sons and one daughter
all walking in the love of GOD. Let this strengthen your faith, dear
Madam, and encourage you to hope that you shall still see the travail
of the Redeemer’s soul in the salvation of all your children, and be
satisfied. The LORD’s Spirit seems still to be striving with them;
and I trust he will not let them go, till they are enabled to give him
spirit, soul, and body to be sanctified throughout. My poor prayers
shall not be wanting. We often think and talk of you. My wife, with
me, sends you and yours a thousand thanks for all your kindnesses. We
are both pretty well, and have the satisfaction of seeing the glory of
the LORD manifested in the great congregation. O what a blessed master
is JESUS CHRIST. I am just now come to my thirty-fifth year of age. I
blush and am confounded, when I think for what little purpose I have
lived. It is time now to begin to do something for Him, who has done
and suffered so much for me. I beg, dear Madam, you will pray for me
while life lasts. I am the chief of sinners, less than the least of all
saints; but for CHRIST’s sake under manifold obligations to, and am,
dear Madam,

       Your most affectionate, obliged friend and ready servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXCVII.


                           _To Mrs. L――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 15, 1749._

_My dear and honoured Mother_,

I Have been quite uneasy because your things have not been sent. The
woman that was to procure them disappointed me. I hope you will not
miss of them another week. Pray be not uneasy. I should never forgive
myself, was I by my negligence, or any wrong conduct, to give you
a moment’s needless pain. To-morrow will be thirty-five years since
you brought unworthy me into the world. Alas! how little have I done
for you, and how much less for Him who formed me, and has heaped
innumerable mercies upon me ever since I was born. O that my head
was water, and mine eyes fountains of tears, that I might bewail my
barrenness and unfruitfulness in the church of GOD! By his grace, I
hope now to begin to work for Him, who stretched himself on the cross,
and groaned and died for me. His care for his tender mother, excites
me to wish I could do any thing for you. This is my comfort, I hope you
want for nothing. Thanks be to the LORD of all lords for his goodness
to you in your old age! I hope you comfort yourself in him, who I trust
will be your portion for ever. After Christmas I hope to see you. My
wife sends you her most dutiful respects. If you would have any thing
brought more than you have mentioned, pray write to, honoured mother,

                Your ever dutiful, though unworthy son,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCXCVIII.


                            _To Dr. B――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 15, 1749._

AND shall I forget my dear Dr. _B――――_? I cannot, though I have
received no letter from him. I remember his labours of love, I have
heard of the sickness of his dear yoke-fellow, I must not, I cannot
withhold my pen from writing. And what shall I say? I trust your soul
prospers, and that you can cry out with dear Mrs. _B――――_, now in
heaven,

                _――――O happy rod,_
                _That brought me nearer to my GOD._

Surely my dear friend has long ere now been convinced that good desires
will not carry us to heaven. There must be a closing with CHRIST, a
vital union of the soul with GOD, or, in other words, “CHRIST formed
within us.” This was the expression that first convinced me of the new
birth. Since that, I hope it has been in a degree fulfilled in my heart.
I want it to be more and more so, and to have the image of GOD stamped
in more lively characters upon my soul. My dear Doctor, let you and
I begin to strive, not by way of contention, but in a way of holy
emulation, which shall love CHRIST most, and live most to his glory.
I hope that Dr. _W――――_ will join in this strife. Pray my love to him,
to Mr. _S――――_ and family, and to all _Bohemia_ friends. I refer you to
other letters for news, and beg leave to assure you that I am, my dear
Doctor,

            Yours most affectionately in our blessed LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCXCIX.


                            _To Mr. N――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 19, 1749._

_My dear Mr. N――――_,

IT is now almost an age since I wrote to you. Providence prevented my
seeing you when last in the _North_, and ever since, business has kept
me from writing. However, blessed be GOD, I can send you good news now
I do write. For near three months I have preached in many places, and
thousands and ten thousands flocked to hear the glorious gospel. I have
since had repeated letters of the impressions abiding upon the heart
of many. Not unto me, not unto me, O LORD, but unto thy free grace be
all the glory! At _Howarth_ I met with _William Davy_, who has since
been imprisoned for preaching. Though he is seemingly unqualified, yet
I meet with many that date their awakening from their first hearing
him. What shall we say to these things? Even so, Father, for so it
seemeth good in thy sight! I think he belongs to our LORD’s family;
and therefore what is done for him, he will take as done to himself. I
hope all things go on well at _Glasgow_. We have golden seasons here.
Winter quarters are made very agreeable. Many are brought under fresh
awakenings. You must remember us in the kindest manner to all dear
friends. I commend them and you to the mercies of GOD through CHRIST
JESUS, and am, my dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCC.


                           _To Mrs. R――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 20, 1749._

_Dear Madam_,

I Received your letter, and had thoughts of writing to you before
it came; but had forgotten your name, and knew not how to direct. I
rejoice that any good impressions have been made upon your heart by
the blessed Spirit, under my poor unworthy administrations. I hope
this will find you coming up out of the wilderness, leaning upon your
beloved. You know whom I mean. It is the ever-loving, altogether lovely
JESUS, even he who hath loved and given himself for you. I know his
love will constrain you to give yourself, even your whole self to him
in return. This is all he requires, “Give me thy heart.” Amazing! Who
can help echoing back, “My heart, LORD JESUS, will I give.” But we must
give it him as it is. We must come as poor, to be made rich, naked,
to be cloathed, and miserable, to be made happy. O glorious exchange!
precious redemption! May the LORD JESUS shed a sense of it abroad
abundantly in your heart by the Holy Ghost! It is he that must apply,
and bring home what CHRIST has done and suffered for our souls; and
when this is done, the kingdom of GOD is erected in our hearts, and
it is our privilege to go on from strength to strength, till grace is
swallowed up in endless glory. This I hope, dear Madam, you will find
true by happy experience. Your business is to look up continually to
the LORD JESUS, not only as the author, but also as the finisher of
your faith. This will strengthen you under every weakness, and in the
end make you more than conqueror over all. Your concern for Mr. _B――――_,
the Redeemer takes kind at your hand. Fear not, only believe. Press
him with arguments, and GOD with prayers. And who knows but ere long
your husband may draw in the same yoke, and you may live together as
heirs of the grace of life. All things are possible to that JESUS, who
is able to save to the uttermost all that come to the Father in and
through him. To his tender never-failing mercy do I commend you, and am,
dear Madam,

            Your affectionate friend and ready servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCCI.


                         _To Lady Ann H――――._

_Honoured Madam_,

WILL your Ladyship and honoured sister be pleased to accept, though
late, my most hearty and grateful acknowledgments for all the
kindnesses you conferred on me when at _A――――_ place. They are noted in
his book, who has promised, “That a cup of cold water given in the name
of a disciple, shall in no wise lose its reward.” What a beneficent
master does the christian serve! Who would but be his disciple, whose
service is perfect freedom here, and who hath reserved in heaven a
crown of glory for those that love him hereafter? I thank him ten
thousand times for calling unworthy me to embark in his blessed cause!
It is indeed a cause worth embarking in. It gives me great Pleasure
to think, that some poor souls at _A――――_ are under awakenings, and
seem inclined to list under the Redeemer’s banner. Your Ladyship and
honoured sister, I trust, will now have repeated opportunities of
seeing not only how JESUS receives publicans and sinners, but also how
the Spirit of GOD strips the Pharisee of his pitiful fig-leaves, hunts
him out of the trees of the garden (I mean his own tinsel performances),
brings him naked to the bar, makes him see himself on a level with the
worst of sinners, and then sweetly reveals unto him a saviour. Thanks
be to GOD, I have had some blessed instances of this very lately;
especially a boatswain of a ship, who a few weeks ago knew no more
of the corruption of his nature, and the righteousness of CHRIST,
comparatively speaking, than the whistle he used to make use of on
board ship; but now hath undergone a wonderful change. What cannot
grace do? Honoured Madam, I could say much of it, was I not afraid
of being tedious. I hope your Ladyship will not be offended at my
presenting you with Bishop _Hall’s_ works. I thought your Ladyship
and honoured sister might now and then like to read one of the
contemplations, which, in my opinion, are very delightful. That both
you and her Ladyship, and every branch of your noble family, may be
every moment under the guidance and direction of the great Shepherd
and Bishop of souls, is the earnest prayer of, honoured Madam,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                              _London, Jan. 2, 1750._

_My dear Mr. S――――_,

THOUGH I am really very much busied, yet I cannot help complying with
your request, lest it should be any disappointment. I love you in the
bowels of JESUS CHRIST, and earnestly pray our common Head, that you
may be a scribe more and more instructed to the kingdom of GOD, and out
of the good treasure of your heart, bring forth things new and old, for
the Redeemer’s people. The more you are acquainted with, and see your
compleatness in him, the more you will long after an entire conformity
to him, and apply with greater boldness for fresh supplies of life
and strength. His faithfulness must make us faithful. He must be the
_Alpha_ and _Omega_, the first and the last. When we are once taught
this, not notionally, but by the Spirit of GOD, then we shall go on
our way rejoicing, and experience the glorious liberty of the children
of GOD. Thanks be to his name for enlightening you into these truths;
but I love to see the LORD JESUS bringing this about in his own way and
time. He gives us glorious seasons here. Yesterday was a blessed Letter
day. These verses were sung for you, &c.

                    _Thy work in the North,_
                    _O SAVIOUR, increase;_
                    _And kindly send forth_
                    _The preachers of peace._
                    _Till throughout the nation,_
                    _Thy gospel shall ring;_
                    _And peace and salvation_
                    _Each village shall sing._

Thousands said, “Amen, and Amen.” I have had brave news from _Virginia_
and _Scotland_. O for a disinterested spirit! O to be willing to be
poor, that others may be rich! O to be nothing, that JESUS may be all!
I must not enlarge. Let me know when you set out for _Newcastle_, and
whether the books shall be sent by land or water. I get very little by
them. I do not desire it should be otherwise. I believe that as many
are given away, as answers to the profits of what are sold. If souls
are profited, I desire no more. Troubles increase in _Ireland_. You
must remember me to all, and let them demonstrate their love by praying
for, dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCIII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                                              _London, Jan. 2, 1750._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

WITH great pleasure did I receive yesterday a letter from Mr. _N――――_,
informing me of your boldness and success in the glorious gospel of
the ever-blessed GOD. It came just as I was going to read an account of
the LORD’s doings in our parts to multitudes of souls. These lines were
sung for you,

            _Thanks to the LORD, our souls give praise,_
            _Because he makes his vineyard thrive;_
            _Ten thousand thanks that still he rears,_
            _In answer to our daily prayers,_
            _Some faithful servants bold for GOD:_
            _Uphold them by thy chearing blood!_

GOD will hear our prayer; our cry shall come unto him. Go on, my dear
Mr. _G――――_. The more you do, the more you may do for the ever-blessed
JESUS. Be instant in season and out of season, and boldly say,

              _For this let men revile my name,_
              _No cross I’ll shun, I’ll fear no shame;_
              _All ♦hail reproach, and welcome pain,_
              _Only thy terrors, LORD, restrain._

May GOD bless you among the students! Their names are _Legion_. He that
catches one of them, catches many at once. We have blessed seasons here.
I have good news from _Virginia_. I hear every day of fresh persons
lately brought under conviction. A learned gospel minister, who was
lately turned out for the sake of JESUS, I believe will be up here
soon. Grace! grace! The more we are cast out, the more will JESUS come
in unto us. You must remember me to all. Want of leisure, not of love,
prevents my writing. I have frequently scarce time to eat bread: and
little of that serves me. But JESUS is the bread of life. Whilst his
servants feed others, he feasts them. Do you not find this true by
happy experience? I know you do. Go on, press forward, dear Sir, and
you shall find it more and more. Excuse this hasty scribble. I hope to
answer Mr. _N――――_ shortly. My wife joins in cordial salutations to all,
with, reverend and dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                            LETTER DCCCIV.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. C――――._

                                              _London, Jan. 3, 1750._

_My dear Friend_,

YOUR letter surprized me; but _benefacere & male pati hoc vere
christianus est_. If your friend does not hurt himself, he is in no
danger from me. I think sometimes of _Joseph_; He that appeared for
him, will in time appear for me, and plead my injured cause. But all
is well. The returns I have hitherto met with, shall not discourage me,
or at least make me to give over and cease from serving you and yours.
Mr. _L――――_ sends me dreadful news from _Cork_. _B――――_ is there again,
making havock of the people. Mr. _H――――_ expected to be murdered every
minute some time ago. I have been with some, who will go to the Speaker
of the House of Commons, and represent the case. I hope I have but
one common interest to serve; I mean, that of the blessed JESUS. O for
simplicity, and godly sincerity! Our LORD abhors guile in all shapes,
and sooner or later it will meet with its own reward. I am glad you
are supported――Our LORD is a ready help in time of need. We have golden
seasons here. Grace! grace! I wish you and yours a happy new year, and
am,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCCV.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                              _London, Jan. 6, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

THE inclosed letters came to hand on _Monday_ last, as a
new-year’s-gift. As they bring such good news, I must communicate
them to your Ladyship. The first writer is a _Virginia_ planter, at
whose house I lay, and who with some other gentlemen asked me to play a
game at cards: I refused, and retired to pray for him. His present wife
is my spiritual child. The letters will shew how GOD was pleased to
answer our prayers. This, and other things I meet with, more and more
convinces me, that a liberty to range and publish the gospel wherever
providence shall call me, is what I am to maintain and preserve. Mr.
_A――――_ abides still, and as far as I can judge, disinterested. Blessed
be GOD for stripping seasons! I would not lose the privilege of leaning
only upon the LORD JESUS for thousands of worlds. He alone can make me
happy, and he alone without foreign assistance can bless; and blessed
be his name, he daily makes me so. He has been pleased to remove in
some degree the pain of my breast, and gives me to determine more and
more, that every breath I draw by divine assistance shall be his. I
thank him ten thousand times that your Ladyship is so well pleased with
Mr. _B――――_. He expresses the strong sense he has of the obligations he
lies under to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and under him, to your Ladyship.
O that neither of us may prove ungrateful in any respect! Next week
I hope to let your Ladyship know how affairs go at Mrs. _K――――_’s. I
expect to see her then. Lately his Majesty seeing Lady _Chesterfield_
at court with a grave gown, pleasantly asked her, “whether Mr.
_Whitefield_ advised her to that colour.” O that all were cloathed
in the bright and spotless robe of the Redeemer’s righteousness! How
beautiful would they then appear in the sight of the King of kings!
This, honoured Madam, through free grace, is your dress. That your
honoured sisters, and all your children, may be adorned in like manner,
is the earnest prayer of, honoured Madam,

          Your Ladyship’s most obliged and ready servant for
                            CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCVI.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. H――――._

                                              _London, Jan. 8, 1750._

_My very dear Mr. H――――_,

YOUR letter must not any longer lie by unanswered. It is a pleasure
to me to steal a few minutes to keep up a correspondence with one
I so dearly love, and with whom I am persuaded I shall live in the
regions of peace and joy, through the endless ages of eternity. This
the glorious _Emmanuel_ hath purchased for us, and of this, (for ever
adored be his free grace) he hath given us an earnest! Supported with
this, I am still enabled to pursue my delightful work of preaching to
poor sinners the unsearchable riches of redeeming love. Thousands and
thousands flock to hear, and we have had a blessed Christmas and new
year’s season indeed. In the midst of all, I want more retirement. I
want to read, meditate, and write. But I despair of getting much time
for these things, till I get upon the mighty waters. In the mean while,
I thank the Redeemer for letting my hands be full of work. These words
lately have followed me, “Dwell in the land, be doing good, and verily
thou shalt be fed.” These words embolden me to inform you of two that
love CHRIST, and therefore I believe you love them, and I think they
want assistance; _G―――― F――――_ and _I―――― H――――_. The former I think
has about eleven children, and scarce a crown a week to maintain them;
and the latter writes me word, “He is about a guinea behind hand.” I am
doing what I can for them, and if you would send them a small token, or
now and then let me have a little to give to the many christian objects
that apply to me, I know not how your generous heart could lay out a
little to more advantage. You know the pleasure of doing for CHRIST’s
disciples. I labour to contract every expence, and to save all I can
for the good of others. Ought I not to do so, to express my gratitude
to him, who for my sake had not where to lay his head, and though he
was rich, yet he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made
rich. Much, yea very much of his divine unction do I pray may be given
to my dear Mr. _H――――_ in his present plan. May the LORD make your pen
the pen of a ready writer, and after death may your writings be blest
to thousands yet unborn! I believe they will. O my dear friend, whilst
I am writing the fire kindles. Blessed be GOD for JESUS CHRIST! Blessed
be GOD for all the mercies he hath conferred upon us! O that this new
year may be filled with good works, flowing from a principle of love
and a new nature! That the LORD may bless and keep you, and fill you
with all his divine fulness, is the continual earnest prayer of, my
dear, dear old friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCVII.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. B――――._

                                             _London, Jan. 12, 1750._

_My very dear Sir_,

LEST I should be hindered to-morrow, or in the beginning of the week,
I now sit down to answer your kind letter. O that I may be helped to
write something that may do you service, and be a means of quickening
you in that delightful cause in which you are embarked. I see, my dear
Sir, you are like to have hot work, before you quit the field:――For
I find you have begun to batter Satan’s strongest hold, I mean the
self-righteousness of man. Here, Sir, you must expect the strongest
opposition. It is the _Diana_ of every age. It is the golden image,
which that apostate _Nebuchadnezzar_, Man, continually sets up; and the
not falling down to worship it, but much more for us to speak, write,
or preach against it, exposes one immediately to the fury of its blind
votaries, and we are thrown directly into a den of devouring lions.
But fear not, Mr. _B――――_, the GOD whom we serve, the captain under
whose banner we are listed, is able to deliver us. He knows how to
train us up gradually for war, and is engaged to bring us off more than
conquerors from the field of battle. If any one need give way, it must
be the poor creature that is writing to you, for I believe there is
not a person living, more timorous by nature. But I trust in a degree,
JESUS hath delivered me from worldly hopes and worldly fears, and by
his grace strengthening me, he makes me often bold as a lion. But O,
my dear Sir, this pretty character of mine I did not at first care to
part with; ’twas death to be despised, and worse than death to think of
being laughed at by all. But when I began to consider Him who endured
such contradiction of sinners against himself, I then longed to drink
of the same cup, and blessed be GOD, contempt and I are pretty intimate,
and have been so for above twice seven years. JESUS’s love makes it a
very agreeable companion, and I no longer wonder that _Moses_ made such
a blessed choice, and rather chose to suffer affliction with the people
of GOD, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. May the LORD
JESUS make us thus minded! For there is no doing good without enduring
the scourge of the tongue; and take this for a certain rule, “The more
successful you are, the more hated you will be by Satan, and the more
despised you will be by those that know not GOD.” What has the honoured
Lady suffered under whose roof you dwell! Above all, what did your
blessed master suffer, who hath done such great things for you? O let
us follow him, though it be through a sea of blood. I could enlarge,
but time will not permit. I am ashamed of my unprofitableness, and must
retire, after begging that you will not forget, reverend and dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCVIII.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                             _London, Jan. 12, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

THOUGH I have missed two posts, yet the only cause of my not writing
was a fear of being troublesome, and too particular and prolix in the
accounts sent your Ladyship in my last letters. Your Ladyship’s kind
letter this afternoon, together with the inclosed, which I received
yesterday, give me fresh occasion to renew that pleasing employ of
acquainting your Ladyship with some more particulars. Every day we have
new hearers, and I find some or another are almost continually brought
under convictions, or are edified at the tabernacle. I have offered
Mr. _W――――_ to assist occasionally at his chapel, and I don’t know but
it may be accepted. Your Ladyship will hear soon. O that I may learn
from all I see, to desire to be nothing! and to think it my highest
privilege to be an assistant to all, but the head of none. I find a
love of power sometimes intoxicates even GOD’s own dear children, and
makes them to mistake passion for zeal, and an over-bearing spirit for
an authority given them from above. For my own part, I find it much
easier to obey than govern, and that it is much safer to be trodden
under foot, than to have it in one’s power to serve others so. This
makes me fly from that, which at our first setting out we are too apt
to court. Thanks be to the LORD of all Lord’s for taking any pains with
ill and hell deserving me! I cannot well buy humility at too dear a
rate. This is a grace after which your Ladyship pants, and with which
our LORD will delight to fill you more and more. Your Ladyship’s letter
convinces me, that those who know and do most, think they know and
do least. If it were not so, grace itself would prove our bane, and
goodness and zeal, through the pride and corruption of our hearts,
be our destroyers. Honoured Madam, my hands and heart are continually
lifted up for you, that you may abound evermore in every good word and
work, and be cloathed with that humility which your Ladyship delights
to wear every day; I mean that humble mind which was in CHRIST JESUS.
I rejoice exceedingly in the comfort which your Ladyship has in Mr.
_B――――_. I shall take care to cultivate our acquaintance, and earnestly
pray that it may be blessed to our mutual improvement. I trust he will
be a good soldier of JESUS CHRIST, and doubt not ere long I shall hear
of his receiving some wounds and scars of honour in the field of battle.
After I left Mr. _Z――――_, by appointment I went to Mrs. _K――――_, to
whom with the Countess, Lady _G――――_, Mr. _C――――_, and one Mrs. _B――――_,
I gave the blessed sacrament, and afterwards a word of exhortation. Our
LORD was there, and your Ladyship &c. were remembered before him. On
_Tuesday_ next the blessed feast is to be repeated at the Countess’s
house, and on _Wednesday_, GOD willing, I shall leave town for about
five weeks. All I think are as hearty as ever, and I trust some will
take deep root downwards, and bear fruit upwards. His Majesty seems
to have been acquainted with some things about us, by what passed in
his discourse with Lady _Chesterfield_. The particulars are these;
her Ladyship had a suit of cloaths on, with a brown ground and silver
flowers, which was brought from abroad. His Majesty coming round to her,
first smiled and then laughed quite out. Her Ladyship could not imagine
what was the matter. At length his Majesty said, “I know who chose that
gown for you:――Mr. _Whitefield_; and I hear that you have attended on
him this year and half.” Her Ladyship answered, “Yes I have, and like
him very well;” but after she came to her chair, was grieved she had
not said more; so that I find her Ladyship is not ashamed. O that she
and all that have heard the gospel, may have grace given them to speak
of their dear Redeemer, even before kings, when called to it, and not
be daunted! I have also been with the Speaker about the poor people in
_Ireland_. Mr. _G――――_ introduced me, and opened the matter well. His
honour expressed a great regard for your Ladyship, and great resentment
at the indignities the poor sufferers underwent; but said, “Lord
_H――――_ or the secretary of state, were the properest persons to be
applied to, and he did not doubt but that your Ladyship’s application
would get their grievances redressed.” I wished for a memorial to
acquaint him with particulars. He treated me with great candour, and
assured me no hurt was designed us by the state. Mr. _G――――_ was quite
hearty, and has the utmost respect for your Ladyship. To-morrow I am
to preach at Mr. _W――――_’s chapel, and I suppose on _Sunday_ also.
O that I may be a freed-man, and ready to help all that preach and
love the LORD JESUS in sincerity! I bless GOD for Mr. _B――――_, and am
exceedingly obliged to good Lady _A――――_. I am ashamed of the length
of this, but as it is on business, your Ladyship will excuse, honoured
Madam,

             Your Ladyship’s most obliged, ready servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCIX.


                            _To Mr. L――――._

_Very dear Sir_,

LAST _Monday_ I waited upon the Speaker of the House of Commons, with
one Mr. _G――――_, a dissenting minister, who opened our poor suffering
brethren’s case in a proper manner.――The Speaker expressed great
resentment upon hearing of the indignities they had met with, and said,
that if it did properly belong to him, he would make a thorough search
into the affair. But he wondered application had not been made to Lord
_H――――_, who was the King’s representative in _Ireland_. He at the same
time wanted to be informed of more particulars. For want of a memorial,
I could only shew him the contents of your letter. Two things therefore
seem necessary. Be pleased to send a well-attested narrative of the
whole affair, and wait upon Lord _H――――_ yourself. A friend of mine
intends writing to Lord Baron _B――――_. Is he in _Dublin_? As soon as
ever I hear from you, more may be done. In the mean while, the dear
souls have my constant prayers, and shall have my utmost endeavours
to serve them. I count their sufferings my own. Pray let me hear how
they do. We have great peace here. The blessed JESUS manifests himself
among us, and you know that his presence is all in all. Hearty _Amens_
are given, when our friends are mentioned in prayer at tabernacle.
To-morrow I am to preach at Mr. _W――――_’s chapel. O that it may be
for the Redeemer’s glory and his people’s good! I am a debtor to the
_Greek_ and to the _Barbarian_, to the wise and to the unwise, and
think it my highest privilege to preach CHRIST and him crucified to all.
I know you wish me prosperity. Strange! that the love of JESUS should
unite hearts at such a distance, persons who never conversed with each
other. But thus it is. Blessed be GOD, we belong to one family, are
travelling to one country, are redeemed by the same blood, and are
heirs of the same glory. O glorious prospect! How happy are all they
that put their trust in the LORD JESUS! I commend you and yours to his
everlasting mercy, and am, my very dear Sir,

          Yours most affectionately in our Great High Priest,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCCX.


                            _To Mr. H――――._

                                             _London, Jan. 18, 1750._

_My very dear Mr. H――――_,

A Few days ago I received your welcome letter dated _November 1_, at
a time I was wondering that I did not hear oftener from you. Blessed
be GOD for dealing so favourably with my dear families, and for giving
the prospect of such a plentiful crop! I take it as an earnest that the
LORD JESUS will be the LORD GOD of _Bethesda_, and let the world see
that designs founded on him shall prosper. I shall not wonder to hear
by and by that you are P――――t. O that you and I, my dear man, may be
cloathed with humility, and the more we are exalted by others, the
more may we be abased in our own eyes! Then will the high and lofty One
delight to dwell in us, and prosperity itself, that dangerous thing,
shall not destroy us. O that something may now be done for the poor
negroes. A good beginning now is of vast consequence. Pray stir in it,
and let us exert our utmost efforts in striving to bring some of them
to the knowledge of our LORD and Saviour JESUS CHRIST. Mr. _Z――――_ will
readily concur in any proper measures for promoting so blessed a work.
I sent him a copy of your letter, and the original to good Lady _H――――_.
This night I have agreed to take little _Joseph_ and his sister. Mr.
_H―――― A――――_ hath been with me, and I find he is desirous, as are all
their relations, that I should take them, for they will be but poorly
provided for here. I think they have a kind of natural right to be
maintained at _Bethesda_, and I have written to Mr. _B――――_ about it. I
suppose in your next, you will acquaint me with particulars concerning
their father, and how he hath left his affairs. I hear there is a
very little infant, besides the other two. I would willingly have
that likewise, if it could be kept till it is about three years old.
I hope to grow rich in heaven, by taking care of orphans on earth. Any
other riches, blessed be GOD, are out of my view. If the crop answers
expectation, I would have Mrs. _V――――_ and the other poor of _Savannah_
reap the benefit. Pray let one ♦barrel of rice be reserved for them.
O what cannot, and what will not GOD do, if we put our trust in him! O
for faith! O for humility! May I learn of JESUS more and more! He deals
bountifully with us here. We have had a blessed Winter indeed!――I am
pretty well in health, but my wife at present is ill. We salute you
and yours, and all friends, and wishing you the best of blessings, I
subscribe myself, my very dear Friend,

            Yours most affectionately in our dearest LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                             _London, Jan. 23, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

THOUGH I am wearied in walking to and from _South-Audley-street_, yet I
must not omit sending to your Ladyship this night. I would have written
on _Saturday_, but I waited to see the event of things. On _Friday_
I preached at the chapel to a very crowded and affected auditory; Mr.
_W――――_ read prayers. On _Sunday_ I read prayers, and he preached, and
afterwards the sacrament was administred to about twelve hundred. More
attended at the tabernacle than ever. Was it as big again, I believe
on _Sunday_ evenings it would be filled. This day hath been spent with
the Countess, Mrs. _K――――_, Lady _G――――_, Colonel _G――――_, Mr. _H――――_,
and Mr. _G――――_. I gave them the communion, and afterwards preached.
The public minister from _Genoa_ came to hear me, and I believe it
was a profitable season. Lady _F――――_, I hear, holds on, and writes
word to the Countess, that she wishes all were as happy as she hath
been in reading Bishop _Hall_’s contemplations. Since I came home, I
have received the inclosed paragraph that was sent to a friend from
_Portsmouth_. O that it may humble and quicken me! Surely ranging is my
province. Methinks I hear a voice behind me saying, “This is the way,
walk in it.” My heart echoes back, “LORD, let thy presence go along
with me, and then send me where thou pleasest.” Even so LORD JESUS,
Amen and Amen! O that I had strength equal to my will. But indeed,
honoured Madam, this body is a daily trial to me. Sometimes I can
scarce drag the crazy load along. At present, I am too fatigued to
enlarge. However, I would inform your Ladyship, that I do not leave
town till _Tuesday_ next. My wife hath been confined to her bed some
days, but is now, blessed be GOD, upon the recovery. GOD willing, I
hope to write to Mr. _B――――_ and the poor baker soon. If your Ladyship
wants any more books to dispose of, I hope your Ladyship will mention
it in your next. Your Ladyship, Lady _Ann_, &c. were remembered
heartily to-day. May the prayer enter into the ears of the LORD of
Sabaoth! I believe it will. I can only now commend your Ladyship and
honoured relations to the GOD of all grace, and hasten to subscribe
myself, honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most obliged and very chearful servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCXII.


                            _To Mr. H――――._

                                             _London, Jan. 26, 1750._

_My dear Mr. H――――_,

I Wrote to you not long ago, but that is no reason why I should not
drop you a few lines now. I hope they will find you and your dear
yoke-fellow resigned to the dispensations of providence, and chearfully
saying, “It is well.” I write thus, because Mr. _H――――_ informed me in
his last, that old Madam _W――――_ was like to die. If she is yet alive,
you will present to her my sincere love and service. I am endeavouring
to prepare for my great change every day, by looking up to JESUS,
and spending and being spent for the good of those souls for whom he
shed his precious blood. Glory be to his great name, my labour is not
in vain in the LORD. My work increases on my hands, and the prospect
of being serviceable widens continually more and more. I beg the
continuance of your prayers, and assure you that mine, such as they are,
always attend you and yours and all my dear _Carolina_ friends. O that
the _Indian_ land may become indeed wholly christian land! Is there any
thing too hard for the LORD?――Ere long I hope to come and sow a little
seed in your ground. May the LORD JESUS make my way plain before me!
The bearer of this is named _G――――_; he once preached, but has (some
time past) greatly backslidden. To save him from ruin I have taken him
in, and have now sent him to _America_. If he keeps close to GOD and
his book, he may yet do well. If not――he has good parts, and is of a
good family. You will take no notice of what I write concerning him.
I write to you as a friend. I mention it, that if he should turn out
wrong, as I pray GOD he may not, you may see I was not deceived. I hope
you visit _Bethesda_, which I trust will be yet brought to something.
May the LORD hasten the time, when we shall arrive at the _Bethesda_
that is above, even that house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens! I can now add no more, but my most cordial salutations to you,
yours, and all, and subscribe myself, dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_Very dear Sir_,

I Received your kind letter, and am glad to find the storm is a little
abated at _Cork_. I always thought it was too hot to hold long. I
see by Mr. _H――――_ that suffering grace is always given for suffering
times. If they have honoured him so far as to give him some lashes,
for preaching the everlasting gospel, I shall rejoice. Such an instance
of persecution, I am persuaded will stir up the resentment of persons
in power on this side the water. I beg for the dear people’s sake, you
would continue your accounts. They direct me in my prayers, and excite
also the prayers of others. On _Monday_, GOD willing, your letter
shall be read, and in the strength of JESUS CHRIST, we will besiege
the throne of grace once more, in our dear brethrens behalf. Surely we
shall prevail. Neither will I stop, but use all endeavours to extricate
our friends out of their troubles. Inclosed you have a letter to the
Judge. You may send or deliver it as you think proper. I hope you
will wait on Lord _H――――_, and let me hear what he says. The Duke
was spoke to, and last post I wrote to Lady _H――――_ for the memorial,
which if sent, shall be put into the hands of some that are very near
his Majesty. Some honourable women are much your friends; JESUS makes
them so, and when his people are distressed, if needful, a thousand
_Esthers_ shall be raised up. What are all these mountains in the
sight of our great _Zerubabel_? Let him but speak the word, and they
shall become a plain. I am glad my dear Mr. _L――――_’s hopes begin
to brighten. O for faith to look through every cloud! Ere long the
sun of righteousness will shine upon us, and not one cloud be seen to
intercept his blessed rays. I trust I can say, that we have lately felt
many of his benign influences warming our souls, and the prospect of
future usefulness increases daily. O for humility! O for gratitude and
love! I have now preached three times in Mr. _W――――_’s chapel, and each
time the LORD was with us of a truth. Next week I leave town for about
five weeks, but if you write, your letters will be sent to me. In the
spring, I am apt to believe the cloud will move towards _Ireland_; but
future things belong to him, before whom things past, present, and to
come, are one _eternal Now_. Mr. _C――――_ is much obliged to you for
your kindness to his friend. He writes word, that you are a father to
him. The LORD will reward you for all your works of faith, and labours
which proceed from love. Perhaps it may do no harm, to let some know
that application has been made, and is making to several in power here,
and that they all express great resentment at the _Cork_ proceedings. I
find their afflictions are my own, and I pray GOD when they have gotten
rest, they may not grow lukewarm, but like the churches of old, walk
in the comforts of the Holy Ghost and be edified. O for that rest which
remains for the people of GOD! It is just at hand. We have a blessed
foretaste of it here: We shall have a full fruition in the Redeemer’s
kingdom hereafter. I wait for thy salvation, O LORD! I can now only add
my most cordial salutations, and beg the continuance of your prayers
for, very dear Sir,

            Yours most affectionately in our blessed I AM,
                                                              _G. W._

                                          _Gloucester, Feb. 6. 1750._

_Dear Tommy_,

THOUGH I left _London_ in a very weak condition, and the weather was
but bad in coming down, yet the Angel of the everlasting covenant
preserved and strengthened me, and I came to _Gloucester_ last _Friday_
evening. On _Saturday_ evening I preached, and likewise on _Sunday_
evening, and twice the same day in the country,――at the new house,
and at _Hampton_. Hundreds attended that could not come in; and
at _Hampton_ all was still and quiet. I like that place very well.
Yesterday morning I preached at Mr. _Fowler_’s, and our LORD gave
us a blessed season from those words, “I am the bread of life.” On
_Wednesday_ I am to preach at the _New-house_, and on _Thursday_ at Mr.
_Fowler_’s again. From thence I think to go once more to _Hampton_, but
am not yet determined. More come here than can enter, and some young
fellows behave rudely; but that is no wonder; the carnal mind is enmity
with GOD. _C――――_ was rejoiced much with the guinea. How thankful are
some only with the crumbs that fall from others tables! Blessed be
GOD, our branch of work is a poor branch; but if we are honest and
disinterested, dead to parties, and aiming only at the Redeemer’s glory,
and the good of souls, the LORD will appear for us in a manner that
shall even make his children astonished. I never was easier about his
work than now. I see every thing in CHRIST’s hands, and therefore every
thing must end well. Go on then, my dear Sir, and let us be all heart.
Remember me to your wife and all enquiring friends; and cease not
praying for, my dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCXV.


                          _To Colonel G――――._

                                                      _Feb. 8, 1750._

_My very dear C――――_,

YOUR kind letter reached me this day, just as I came out of the country
from preaching the everlasting gospel, and where the blessed Redeemer
was pleased to visit and greatly refresh his people. Last _Monday_ we
had a like feast; and in this place the word has been attended with an
alarming and quickening power. Contrary to my intentions, I have been
prevailed on to stay all this week; so that I do not expect to be at
_Bristol_ till _Monday_ or _Tuesday_ next. A letter, if you are pleased
to favour me with another, may find me there next week. I am sorry to
hear you are ill of an ague; but this, and every thing we meet with
here, is only to shake and free us of our corruptions, and to fit us
more and more for a blessed hereafter. As long as we are below, if we
have not one thing to exercise us, we shall have another. Our trials
will not be removed, but only changed. Sometimes troubles come from
without, sometimes from within, and sometimes from both together.
――Sometimes professed enemies, and sometimes nearest and dearest
friends, are suffered to attack us. But CHRIST is the believer’s
_hollow square_; and if we keep close in that, we are impregnable. Here
only I find my refuge. Garrisoned in this, I can bid defiance to men
and devils. Let who will thwart, desert, or over-reach, whilst I am in
this strong-hold, all their efforts, joined with the prince of darkness,
to disturb or molest me, are only like the throwing chaff against
a brass wall. O my dear Sir, what did I experience on the road this
day! How did I rejoice at the prospect of a judgment to come, and in
the settled conviction, that, to the best of my knowledge, I have no
designs, no views, but to spend and be spent for the good of precious
and immortal souls. O that I may be content to be poor, to make others
rich! O that I may never be suffered to seek my own things, but the
things of the LORD JESUS! His hand, without adding our carnal policy
to it, will support his own cause, and make it more than conqueror over
all. When fleshly wisdom, carnal reason, or human cunning is made use
of, what is it, but, like _Uzza_, to give a wrong touch to GOD’s ark,
and in the end provoke GOD to smite us? I love you, dear Sir, because
I hope and believe you have a tenderness for all that belong to JESUS.
I pray GOD to increase this spirit in you. For what we lose of this,
so much we lose of heaven, and so far are we destitute of the mind that
was and is in JESUS. A bigotted, sectarian, party spirit cometh not
from above, but is sensual, earthly, devilish. Many of GOD’s children
are infected with it; but then they are sick of a bad distemper. May
the Spirit of GOD convince and cure them! But whither am I running?
Excuse, dear Sir, the overflowings of a heart, at present, I hope,
filled with the love of GOD. It is free, unmerited, distinguishing,
infinite love, or it would never flow into my ungrateful soul. As our
LORD enables, I shall remember all you desire. The King and his family
I always remember in the most explicit manner. I hope you will succeed
for _Miles_, and for the poor sufferers in _Ireland_. Learn of _Esther_,
and go in the name of JESUS of _Nazareth_. Your relations are in
the same condition as mine. Are we not as brands plucked out of the
burning? Free grace! free grace! I hope to spend an eternity with you
in praising the LORD of all lords for it. You will remember me to all,
chiefly to the friend of all. You know my name, “The chief of sinners;”
but for CHRIST’s sake, very dear Sir,

                Your most obliged, affectionate friend,
                      and very chearful servant,
                                                              _G. W._

                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                            _Bristol, Feb. 12, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

WITH great pleasure (on my coming to _Bristol_ last night) I heard of
your Ladyship’s recovery from your late indisposition. May the LORD of
all lords perfect the begun blessing, and give you to live many years
to be an ornament to his church, and a blessing to his people. Since
I wrote last, we have been favour’d both in _Gloucester_ city, and
in the country, with very pleasant and delightful seasons. I have
preached about twenty times within these eight or nine days; and though
frequently exposed to rain and hail, thanks be to the ever-loving,
ever-lovely JESUS, am much better than when I left _London_. I hear
that they go on well in _London_; and if we can be helped to keep a
single eye, I am persuaded in the end we shall see greater things than
ever. Every thing I meet with seems to carry this voice with it, “Go
thou and preach the gospel; be a pilgrim, be a stranger here on earth;
have no party, or certain dwelling-place; but be continually preparing
for, and labouring to prepare others for, a house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens.” My heart at present echoes back, “LORD JESUS,
help me to do or suffer thy will; only let me be kept by thy mighty
power, and when thou seest me in danger of nestling, in pity, tenderest
pity, put a thorn in my nest to preserve me from it.” Hitherto he has
in mercy answered my prayer; and though sometimes painful to the flesh,
I thank him for it with my inmost Spirit. But surely no one’s heart
requires so much pains to be taken with it, as doth mine. Surprizing,
that the friend of sinners should yet regard me! I must still cry,
“Grace! grace!” At present, honoured Madam, I am lost in wonder.
May the LORD JESUS be with your spirit, and with the spirit of your
honoured sisters, whom I always remember. I doubt not but they were
much concerned at your Ladyship’s illness. May they long live with you,
to be fellow-helpers of each others faith, and to shine as lights in
the world! I hope the work goes on at _Ashby_. How matters go on here,
your Ladyship shall know hereafter. I purpose continuing at _Bristol_
till _Monday_ next. I believe my brother thinks it best to have your
little orphan-boy as soon as possible. May the blessing of many ready
to perish descend on your Ladyship! I must now add no more, but my most
dutiful respects, and my sincere acknowledgements of being, honoured
Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful and ready servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXVII.


                            _To Mr. W――――._

                                            _Bristol, Feb. 15, 1750._

_My dear Mr. W――――_,

WHAT shall I say? Really I can scarce tell what to say, because I have
been so long silent to my dear _New-England_ friends. But indeed were
they to know my circumstances, they would pity me; for my hands have
been continually so full of work, and my removes from place to place
so frequent, that I often had scarce time to eat bread. However, I must
now break through all restraints, and snatch a few moments to inform my
dear Mr. _W――――_, that I can set up my _Ebenezer_, and say, “Hitherto
hath my GOD helped me.” Words cannot well express how bountifully
he has been pleased to deal with me. The prospect of doing good in
my native country, is more and more promising every day. Last fall,
the LORD of the harvest was pleased to give us a most delightful
seed-time in many places in the _North_ of _England_;――in _Lancashire_,
_Cheshire_, _Yorkshire_, _Nottingham_, _Newcastle_, &c. the word
of the LORD ran and was glorified, and I hear of fruit remaining in
every place. At _London_ this Winter, the glory of the LORD filled
the Tabernacle, and since I have been in the country, we have had
delightful seasons. I am now going _Westward_, and in about two months
time purpose going to _Scotland_ and _Ireland_, and then shall embark
for my dear _America_ once more. My health is much restored to me, and
I only want an humble and thankful heart. O my dear friend, what cannot
GOD do? Ought I not to spend and be spent for the good of souls? Ought
I not to be always upon the full stretch for Him, who was stretched
upon the accursed tree for me? Yes, the LORD being my helper, I will
now begin to be in earnest. And O that I may hear that a prayer-hearing
GOD has revived his work in dear _New-England_! You must let this serve
as an historical letter, to be read to my dear friends. I would write
to many, but indeed I have not time. I long as much to see them, as
they can do to see me. I begin to count the days, and to say to the
months, “Fly fast away, that I may once more spread the gospel net
in dear _America_.” But my time and seasons are in thy hands, O LORD;
do with me as seemeth good in thy sight, only let me love thee, and
continue faithful unto death! You will remember me to my honoured
friends and brethren in the ministry, and to all others as they come in
your way. That grace, mercy, and peace may be multiplied upon you all,
is the hearty prayer of, very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXVIII.

_Honoured Madam_,

BLESSED be the GOD and Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, who, in mercy
to his church and people, is pleased yet to hold your soul in life,
and make your Ladyship instrumental in plucking sinners as brands out
of the burning. All these things I look upon only as the earnests of
good things to come. Goodness and mercy will follow your Ladyship all
the days of your life, and you shall dwell in the house of the LORD
for ever. Lady _Ann_’s sudden shock proves that the old observation is
true, “Seldom one affliction comes alone.” I rejoice to hear that her
Ladyship is recovered, and pray the LORD of all lords so to sanctify
it to her Ladyship’s better part, that she may be ready at a moment’s
warning to go forth and meet the heavenly bridegroom. O to be always
ready! to have nothing to do, but to die! Surely the Redeemer hath
purchased this blessing for us. Doth not your Ladyship find it
difficult to be resigned to live, and to continue so long absent from
the LORD? But there is one consideration which may make life desirable
to the greatest saint on earth; he may here do and suffer for JESUS,
and call sinners to him; but in heaven all this will be over. Come
life then, come death, JESUS may thy will be done in, by, and upon thy
people! I know your Ladyship’s heart echoes back, Amen. But what shall
I say to the opposition arising at _Ashby_? I trust it is a sign that
good has already been done, and that more is still doing. The Searcher
of hearts knows how highly I value your Ladyship’s letters; yet I
think it honour enough to have leave to write to your Ladyship, without
expecting punctual answers. O that I may gladden your Ladyship’s heart
with glad tidings from the _West_! I believe I shall. I have been much
helped in preaching here, and have heard of two that were thoroughly
awakened when I was here last. Mr. _H――――_, I think, does not lose
ground. The persons that seem calculated to do him service, must be
such as have a knowledge of themselves, of the world, and of GOD, whose
practice proves their eye to be single, and their minds disinterested,
and who have gone several stages before him to heaven. These would
command respect from him; these he would hear, and to their judgment he
would pay a great deference. The Captain, blessed be GOD, begins to be
weary of his fine house; and I hope will be so uneasy in every worldly
state, as to find no rest for the soles of his feet. May the glorious
JESUS reach out the hand of his mercy, take him into the ark, and shut
the door fast upon him! But I forget that your Ladyship is yet confined
to your room. May the LORD JESUS make it a _Bethel_, a house of GOD,
and a gate of heaven to your soul! He will, he will. I hear that the
Tabernacle people are blessed in _London_. I am quite easy about that,
and every other public concern, and desire nothing but to approve
myself upright and disinterested in the sight of GOD and man. I hope
your Ladyship will never find any thing to the contrary in, honoured
Madam,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCXIX.


                         _To Mr. J―――― B――――._

_My dear Mr. B――――_,

I Received your kind letter a few days ago at _Bristol_, and
embrace this first opportunity of answering it. In _London_ I was so
continually busied with a multiplicity of avocations, that I could not
possibly write to you from thence. However, it has pleased him, whose
mercy endureth for ever, to give me and his dear people a very pleasant
and warm Winter; and I trust much real good hath been done to precious
and immortal souls. Just before I left town, I preached four or five
times in Mr. _W――――_’s chapel, and administred the sacrament twice or
thrice. Congregations were very large, and the Redeemer caused much of
his glory to pass before us. At _Bristol_, and in _Gloucestershire_,
we have had delightful seasons. At the former I saw and dined with Mr.
_C―――― W――――y_, who talked about my preaching in their new room. I said
but little, having, as the Searcher of hearts knows, to the best of my
knowledge, no view to head or gather a party, but only to preach CHRIST
crucified to all. In this I am blessed, in this I find unspeakable
freedom, and to this, the necessity I lie under of labouring on both
sides the water, evidently calls me. I am now going _Westward_. Some
time in _April_ I purpose, GOD willing, to visit your parts again in
my way to _Scotland_, and then we can talk over many things. I think
it is high time that all reasonings _pro_ and _con_ about what is past,
should be buried in utter oblivion. But I fear――――However, this is
my comfort――“The LORD reigneth.” Our business is to be guileless, and
to go forwards, looking continually to that JESUS, in whose cause we
are embarked. He will order all things well. I cannot do any thing at
present for _W―――― D――――_. I tried my utmost for Mr. _C――――_. If he
turns out bad, woe be to him, after such providential interpositions.
I have no intimate correspondence with Mr. _S――――_, but hear by Mr.
_B――――_, that he is blest in the parts round about him. I see that
he and all young preachers need the Apostle’s caution, to “Take heed,
lest being puffed up with pride, they fall into the condemnation of
the devil.”――And this I know, that no one will stand long in this work,
unless he is disinterested, and looks for nothing but poverty, disgrace,
and death. Whosoever is willing thus to lose his life shall find it;
and, on the contrary, whosoever by sinister ends or practices seeks to
save his life, the same (mark the end) shall lose it. For the present
adieu! The LORD be with you and yours! Be pleased to remember me to all
as they come in your way. Direct as usual; and cease not to pray for,
dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCXX.


                           _To Mrs. G――――._

                                               _Exon, Feb. 22, 1750._

_Dear Madam_,

I Rejoice to hear by your last kind letter, that the seed sown at
_Manchester_ begins to spring up. More especially, I desire to be
thankful, that you have grace given you, Madam, to confess the LORD
JESUS and his gospel before men. A blessed earnest this, of your being
confessed by him before his Father and the holy angels in the kingdom
of heaven. The inward peace and satisfaction you enjoy by so doing,
I am persuaded far surpasses all you ever enjoyed, or could possibly
enjoy in the polite world. With what unspeakable comfort can you now
sing,

              _Be gone, vain world, my heart resign,_
              _For I must be no longer thine;_
              _A nobler, a diviner guest,_
              _Now claims possession of my breast._

And if the beginning of the divine life be so sweet, what must the end
be, when this mortal puts on immortality, and the soul rises to all the
fulness of GOD. Blessed be GOD, who has given you to choose that better
part, that shall never be taken from you! What have you to do now, but
daily to sit at the dear Redeemer’s feet and hear his word; I mean,
search the scriptures, which testify of him: and for His great name’s
sake, let your remaining life be one continued sacrifice of love to
GOD and man. This is true faith, even a faith that works by love, and
overcomes this wicked world. Well may it be stiled _precious faith_. It
is precious in itself, and precious in its fruits. It lays hold on, and
unites to CHRIST, and carries out the soul day by day after a nearer
conformity to him. It goes on from strength to strength, and conducts
the soul at length to the perfect and uninterrupted vision of the
ever-blessed GOD. Methinks I hear you say, “LORD, evermore give me
this faith.” He will, Madam, he will: for he giveth liberally, and
upbraideth not. Be not afraid of asking too much. Lay your foundation
deep in the knowledge of yourself, and you cannot build too high. O
that the worthy Captain may bear you company to heaven! I trust he will.
Perhaps some time in the Spring, I may have the pleasure of waiting
upon you. I am now in the _West_, and have had blessed seasons in my
way hither. Good Lady _H――――n_ hath been ill, but is recovering. There
hath been an awakening at _Ashby_; but opposition begins to shew itself
in these parts by the instrumentality of a dissenting minister. That
the number may daily increase among you, and that you and yours may be
watered every moment, is the hearty prayer of, Madam,

        Your most obliged and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER [♦DCCCXX.]


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                           _Plymouth, Feb. 25, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

THE day after I wrote to your Ladyship my last letter, I preached three
times, once at _Kingswood_, and twice at _Bristol_. In the evening I
stood at _Smith_’s hall window and preached. It was a blessed day. The
next morning our ascended Saviour gave me much of his presence, and
I came on my way rejoicing. At _Taunton_ I met with Mr. _Pearsall_,
a Dissenting minister, a preacher of righteousness before I was born.
At _Wellington_ I lay at the house of one Mr. _Darracott_, a flaming
successful preacher of the gospel, and who, I think, may justly be
stiled (what Mr. _Hieron_ was some years ago) the star in the _West_.
He hath suffered much reproach; the common lot of all that are owned
in the LORD’s vineyard: and in the space of three months, he hath
lost three lovely children. Two of them died the _Saturday_ evening
before the sacrament was to be administred; but weeping did not hinder
sowing. He preached the next day, and administered as usual. Our LORD
strengthened him; and for his three natural, hath given him above
thirty spiritual children: and he is in a likely way of having many
more. He has ventured his little all for CHRIST; and last week a saint
died who left him and his heirs two hundred pounds in land. Did ever
any one trust in the LORD and was forsaken? At his place I began to
take the field for this _Spring_. At a very short warning, a multitude
of souls assembled, and the bread of life, that cometh down from
heaven, was dispensed amongst them. The following evening I preached
at _Exeter_, where there is a little flock, and last night and this
morning I have preached here: I humbly hope to the comfort of many.
This afternoon, GOD willing, I am to take the field again. What success
I meet with here, and in _Cornwall_, your Ladyship shall know by
another opportunity. I am now waiting for a letter from Mr. _B――――_,
which I hope will bring me the wish’d-for news of the confirmation of
your Ladyship’s health. This is what I continually pray for from my
inmost soul. I am sorry to inform your Ladyship (if it has not reached
you before) that Mr. _A――――_ of _London_ is dead. I think he was one of
the most lively, and like to have been the most successful Dissenting
preacher in that great city: but our LORD orders all things well. The
residue of the Spirit is in his hands. Blessed Redeemer, quicken my
tardy pace, and make me also ready! Good Lady _Ann_ I hope is now
perfectly recovered. But why do I talk of a perfect recovery in this
dying life? Then only shall we be perfectly recovered, when we awake
in the morning of the resurrection after our Redeemer’s likeness; then,
and not till then, will my poor soul be fully satisfied; then, and
not till then, will your Ladyship fully know how much the temporal and
eternal welfare of your Ladyship is desired and prayed for by, honoured
Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most humble, dutiful, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                       _To the Rev. Mr. H――――._

                                           _Plymouth, Feb. 25, 1750._

_Reverend and dear Sir_,

YOUR letters always fill me with sympathy. Your last I have just been
reading; and in reading breathed out this ejaculation, “LORD, when will
the days of his mourning be ended.” Surely you are not always thus to
stick fast in the mire and clay. Certainly the time will come, when
the dear Redeemer will put your feet upon a rock, and a song into
your mouth, and order your going for the promoting his glory and his
people’s good. _Satan_ hath indeed desired to have you, that he may
sift you as wheat; but CHRIST, a sympathizing, compassionate high-
priest, prays for you, and your faith shall not fail. Look up then,
my dear Mr. _H――――_; you shall find grace to help in time of need.

              _Leave to his sovereign sway_
                _To choose and to command;_
              _So shalt thou wond’ring own his way,_
                _How wise, how strong his hand._
              _Far, far above thy thoughts,_
                _His counsel shall appear,_
              _When fully he the work hath wrought,_
                _That caus’d thy needless fear._

This is the advice I give you. I know you will pray that I may take it
myself. For I find, that sufficient for every day is the evil thereof.
But the LORD causes me to renew my strength, and blessed be his name,
enables me to go on my way rejoicing. In _London_ we have had a blessed
Winter. In the country we have seen a Spring time. Hither I came last
night, and have preached twice since my coming. Thus I live a moving
life. O that I may be a pilgrim indeed, and desire no continuing
city till I come to the _New Jerusalem_, which is above, and the
mother of us all. There, all that are born of GOD, whether _Mysticks_,
_Calvinists_, &c. shall join in one common song, even the song of
_Moses_ and of the LAMB. Your hymn, for which I thank you, is a
preparative for this. I sent it to good Lady _H――――n_, who has been ill,
but is now, I hope, recovered. Pray write to me often. Sorrows grow
less, and joys greater, by being communicated. Load me as much as you
will with all your grievances, and I will lay them before Him, who came
to bear our sicknesses, and heal our infirmities. Pray what is become
of Mr. _S――――_? Will he preach, now he is sure of something in hand?
But alas! the disease is in the heart. When the love of GOD reigns
there, then and not till then will the love and fear of the world flee
away. Blessed freedom, wherewith JESUS CHRIST makes his servants free!
Remember me when at his footstool, and write long and often to,
reverend and dear Sir,

                              Your’s, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXXII.


                            _To Mr. F――――._

                                           _Plymouth, Feb. 26, 1750._

_My dear Mr. F――――_,

EVER since I received your last kind letter, I have been endeavouring
to redeem some time to answer it, but till now have not had opportunity.
Indeed even now a multiplicity of business obliges me to be much more
brief than otherwise I should. However, I cannot help informing you,
that I am glad that the gentlemen of _Philadelphia_ are exerting their
efforts to erect an academy. I have often thought such an institution
was wanted exceedingly; and if well-conducted, am persuaded it will be
of public service. Your plan I have read over, and do not wonder at its
meeting with general approbation. It is certainly well calculated to
promote polite literature; but I think there wants _aliquid Christi_
in it, to make it so useful as I would desire it might be. It is true,
you say, “The youth are to be taught some public religion, and the
excellency of the christian religion in particular:” but methinks
this is mentioned too late, and too soon passed over. As we are all
creatures of a day; as our whole life is but one small point between
two eternities, it is reasonable to suppose, that the grand end of
every christian institution for forming tender minds, should be to
convince them of their natural depravity, of the means of recovering
out of it, and of the necessity of preparing for the enjoyment of the
supreme Being in a future state. These are the grand points in which
christianity centers. Arts and sciences may be built on this, and serve
to embellish and set off this superstructure, but without this, I
think there cannot be any good foundation. Whether the little _Dutch_
book I have sent over, will be of any service in directing to such a
foundation, or how to build upon it, I cannot tell. Upon mentioning
your desire to the King’s _German_ chaplain, a worthy man of GOD; he
sent it to me, and thought, if translated, it might be of service.
Glad should I be of contributing, though it was but the least mite,
in promoting so laudable an undertaking; but the gentlemen concerned
are every way so superior to me, both in respect to knowledge of books
and men, that any thing I could offer, I fear, would be of very little
service. I think the main thing will be, to get proper masters that are
acquainted with the world, with themselves, and with GOD, and who will
consequently naturally care for the welfare of the youth that shall
be committed to their care. I think also in such an institution,
there should be a well-approved christian Orator, who should not be
content with giving a public lecture in general upon oratory, but who
should visit and take pains with every class, and teach them early
how to speak, and read, and pronounce well. An hour or two in a day, I
think, ought to be set apart for this. It would serve as an agreeable
amusement, and would be of great service, whether the youth be intended
for the pulpit, the bar, or any other profession whatsoever. I wish
also, that the youth were to board in the academy, and by that means be
always under the master’s eye. And if a fund could be raised, for the
free education of the poorer sort, who should appear to have promising
abilities, I think it would greatly answer the design proposed. It hath
been often found, that some of our brightest men in church and state,
have arisen from such an obscure condition. When I heard of the academy,
I told Mr. _B――――_, that the new building, I thought, would admirably
suit such a proposal; and I then determined in my next to mention
some terms that might be offered to the consideration of the Trustees.
But I find since, that you have done this already, and that matters
are adjusted agreeable to the minds of the majority. I hope your
agreement meets with the approbation of the inhabitants, and that it
will be serviceable to the cause of vital piety and good education.
If these ends are answered, a free-school erected, the debts paid,
and a place preserved for public preaching, I do not see what
reason there is for any one to complain. But all this depends on the
integrity, disinterestedness, and piety of the gentlemen concerned.――An
institution, founded on such a basis, GOD will bless and succeed; but
without these, the most promising schemes will prove abortive, and the
most flourishing structures, in the end, turn out mere _Babels_. I wish
you and the gentlemen concerned much prosperity; and pray the LORD of
all lords to direct you to the best means to promote the best end; I
mean, the glory of GOD, and the welfare of your fellow-creatures. Be
pleased to remember me to them and all friends as they come in your way,
and believe me, dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

_Honoured Sir_,

I Was much rejoiced to hear, by a letter lately received from Mr.
_Bradford_, that your Excellency was pretty well, and am very thankful
that you was pleased to enquire so cordially after unworthy me. I take
this first opportunity of returning my most grateful acknowledgements,
and to assure your Excellency, you are not forgotten by me at the
throne of grace. Ere now, I thought to have waited upon you in person,
but it hath pleased Him, whose I am, and whom I desire to serve in
the gospel of his dear Son, to detain me longer than I expected in
my native country. The door for usefulness opens wider and wider. The
seed sown among the rich, springs up and bears fruit in some; and the
poor in various places receive the gospel more gladly than ever. Last
fall was a glorious seed-time in the _North_ of _England_. In _London_
we had a warm winter; and in the country we have had reason to sing,
that “the voice of the turtle is again heard in the land.” GOD willing,
I purpose ranging this Summer, and then to embark for my beloved
_America_ once more. Whether I shall see your Excellency is uncertain.
You are upon the decline of life; and for my own part, I wonder that I
live so long. But I trust I shall meet your Excellency in heaven, where
the wicked heart, the wicked world, and wicked devil will cease from
troubling, and every soul enjoy an uninterrupted and eternal rest. This
I am waiting for every day; and according to the present frame of my
soul, desire no continuing city, till I arrive at and take possession
of the _New-Jerusalem_ above. My Master makes ranging exceedingly
pleasant; and I hope in his strength to begin now to begin to spend
and be spent for him, who shed his own dear heart’s blood for sinful,
ill, and hell-deserving me. O that death may find me either praying
or preaching! I hope your Excellency will increase my obligations, by
continuing to pray for me. My prayer for you is, “That your Excellency
may bring forth much fruit in old age; and that whensoever you go
off, you may be gathered like a ripe shock of corn into the Redeemer’s
heavenly garner!” That you may till then go on from strength to
strength, and increase with all the increase of GOD, is the earnest
desire of, honoured Sir,

          Your Excellency’s most obliged, dutiful, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXXIV.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                       _Saint-Ginnys, March 5, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Was ashamed to send your Ladyship so short a letter from _Plymouth_,
but it was unavoidable. I was obliged to take horse, and therefore
could only promise your Ladyship to send you particulars afterwards.
At _Plymouth_ I preached twelve times in six days, and the longer I
preached, the more hearers, and the power that attended the word
increased also. Friends grew more hearty, and enemies more softened.
Mr. _T――――_ and Mr. _G――――_ came to _Plymouth_ to meet me. I preached
at _Tavistock_ in my way hither, and yesterday was a glorious day
of the Son of man. Our LORD gave us to see his stately steps and
out-goings in the sanctuary. Four of Mr. _Wesley_’s Preachers were
present, and also four Clergymen in their gowns and cassocks.――Mr.
_Bennet_ aged fourscore, Mr. _Thompson_, Mr. _Grigg_, and myself. It
was a day of fat things. By the advice and desire of friends, I am
going further Westward, and shall take care to let your Ladyship know,
how the LORD is pleased to deal with me and his dear people.


                                                 _Redruth, March 10._

Though the above was begun at _St. Ginnys_, yet I have not been able to
go on with it till now. Every day I have been travelling and preaching,
and could I stay one month, it might be spent to great advantage. At a
place called _Port-Isaac_ the Redeemer’s stately steps were seen indeed,
and his people were filled as with new wine. At _Camelford_ I preached
with great quietness in the street. At _St. Andrews_ we had a very
powerful season, and yesterday at _Redruth_ several thousands attended,
and the word was quick and powerful. Invitations are sent to me from
_Falmouth_, and several other places. I want more tongues, more bodies,
more souls for the LORD JESUS. Had I ten thousand, he should have them
all. After preaching, about noon I am to go to _St. Ives_, and in about
nine days I hope to be at _Exeter_. Your Ladyship shall be sure to hear
how the LORD prospers the gospel plough. Mr. _T――――_ is mighty hearty,
and gone to his parish in a gospel flame. The people here want it much.
Surely, GOD will some time or another turn their captivity. Mr. _T――――_
desired his most dutiful respects might be presented to your Ladyship.
Blessed be GOD, that you are better. I am not forgetful of your
Ladyship by night or by day. I hope the souls of your honoured sisters
do prosper, and that you will yet live to see JESUS CHRIST formed in
all your relations hearts. That every thing your Ladyship writes, says,
or does, may be mightily blessed and owned of the dear Redeemer, is the
continual prayer of, honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCXXV.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                           _Exeter, March, 21, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Think it is now almost an age since I wrote to your Ladyship, but
travelling and preaching have prevented me. Immediately after writing
my last, I preached to many thousands, at a place called _Gwinnop_.
The rain dropped gently upon our bodies, and the grace of GOD seemed
to fall like a gentle dew and sprinkling rain upon our souls. It was
indeed a fine spring shower. In the evening I rode sixteen miles to _St.
Ives_, and preached to many that gladly attended to hear the word; a
great power seemed to accompany it. On the morrow, being LORD’s day, I
preached twice to large auditories, and then rode back again rejoicing
to _Gwinnop_. In my way, I had the pleasure of hearing that good was
done, and had fresh calls to preach elsewhere. In the morning I went
to church, and heard a virulent sermon from these words, “Beware of
false prophets.” On _Saturday_ the preacher was heard to say, “Now
_Whitefield_ was coming, he must put on his old armour.” It did but
little execution, because not scripture proof, and consequently not
taken out of GOD’s armory. On _Monday_ I preached again at _Redruth_,
at ten in the morning, to near (as they were computed) ten thousand
souls. Arrows of conviction seemed to fly fast. In the evening I
preached to above five hundred, at twelve miles distant, and then rode
about sixteen miles to one Mr. _B――――_’s, a wealthy man, convinced
about two years ago. In riding, my horse threw me violently on the
ground, but by GOD’s providence, I got up without receiving much hurt.
The next day we had a most delightful season at _St. Mewens_, and
the day following a like time, at a place called _Port-Isaac_. In
the evening, I met my dear Mr. _Thompson_ again at Mr. _Bennet_’s, a
friendly minister aged fourscore, and on _Thursday_ preached in both
his churches. Blessed seasons both! On _Friday_ we went to _Biddeford_,
where there is perhaps one of the best little flocks in all _England_.
The power of GOD so came down while I was expounding to them, that Mr.
_Thompson_ could scarce stand under it. I preached twice; a commanding,
convincing influence went forth a second time, and one came to me the
next morning under awakenings. The LORD JESUS has here brought home a
lawyer; and one of the youngest but closest reasoners that ever I met
with, is now under deep convictions. On _Monday_ evening I came to
_Exeter_, and with great regret shall stay till _Friday_. For I think
every day lost, that is not spent in field preaching. An unthought
of and unexpectedly wide door is opened in _Cornwall_, so that I have
sometimes almost determined to go back again. I beg the continuance
of your Ladyship’s prayers, and hope Mr. _B――――_ will let me know of
your Ladyship’s welfare. You will not be forgotten by, honoured Madam,

          Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and chearful
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXXVI.


                       _To the Countess D――――._

                                            _Exeter, March 21, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Did not think of being so long out of _London_, without sending
your Ladyship a letter; but I have been so employed in travelling
and preaching and answering letters, that I have scarce had any time
at all. However, I bless the glorious Redeemer, that I can now send
your Ladyship good news. Every where the word of GOD has ran and been
glorified. I am just returned from near the land’s end, where thousands
and thousands heard the gospel gladly. I have generally preached twice
a day, and rode several miles; but my greatest grief is, that I can
do no more for the blessed JESUS. Wherever I am, your Ladyship and
honoured sister, with the other honourable ladies, are continually
remembered by me at the throne of grace. I hope all are determined with
full purpose of heart to cleave unto the LORD. The earthquake hath been
an alarming providence. Happy they, that have an interest in CHRIST,
and are always ready! On Him alone is my strength and safety founded.
Did not this support and comfort your Ladyship under the awful alarm?
Go on then, honoured Madam, and by a constant looking to JESUS, make
continual advances in the divine life, which I believe hath been
communicated to you from above. The more you see of his excellencies,
the more will all created things sicken and die in your view and taste.
I commend your Ladyship to his never-failing mercy, and beg leave to
subscribe myself, honoured Madam,

       Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, and obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXXVII.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                            _Exeter, March 24, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

AS I am persuaded your heart’s desire and prayer to GOD is, that the
kingdom of the LORD JESUS may be set up on earth, I cannot return to
_London_ without informing your Ladyship, that the gospel has been
most gladly received in these western parts. I have been very near the
land’s end, and every where souls have fled to hear the word preached,
like doves to the windows. The harvest is great, yea very great; but
the labourers are few. O that the LORD of the harvest would thrust
out more labourers! Something out of the common road must be done,
to awaken a thoughtless world. GOD has been terribly shaking the
metropolis. I hope it is an earnest of his giving a shock to secure
sinners, and making them to cry out, “What shall we do to be saved?” I
trust, honoured Madam, you have been brought sweetly to believe on the
LORD JESUS, and have experienced the beginnings of a real salvation in
your heart. What a mercy is this! To be plucked as a brand out of the
burning, to be one of those few _Mighty_ and _Noble_ that are called
effectually by the grace of GOD; what consolation must this administer
to your Ladyship under all afflictions! What can shake a soul whose
hopes of happiness, in time and eternity, are built upon the rock of
ages? Winds may blow, rains may and will descend even upon persons of
the most exalted stations; but they that trust in the LORD JESUS CHRIST
never shall, never can be totally confounded. That your Ladyship may
every day and hour experience more and more of this blessed truth, is
the earnest prayer of, honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obedient humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCXXVIII.


                            _To Mr. L――――._

                                             _London, April 3, 1750._

_Very dear Sir_,

LAST _Friday_ evening I came to town, and would have answered your kind
letters (which I found waiting for me here) last post, had not fatigue
and a multiplicity of business prevented me. Surely the distress of our
suffering friends is great, but he that dwelleth on high is greater.
I have already laid your account before some particular persons,
and shall use all possible means to have our dear friends grievances
redressed. In the interim, let us besiege the throne of grace, and by
earnest prayer engage his assistance, who has promised that the gates
of hell shall never prevail against his Church. As I hear Mr. _John
W――――_ is now in _Ireland_, I suppose he will best answer your question
about “coming out from amongst them.” For my part, I think my business
is to preach the gospel unto all, without setting up any particular
party. The acceptance which the glorious _Emmanuel_ is pleased to give
to me, and the various calls sent, as well as the freedom I find in
complying with them, confirm me more and more that this is my province.
I am just returned from the West, where I have seen the fields every
where white ready unto harvest. Though thousands flock to hear the word
in town, yet I almost think every day lost in which I am not preaching
about the country, now the summer is coming on. GOD only knows whether
I shall reach as far as _Ireland_. Pray continue your accounts. I
cannot help thinking, but that this opposition is a blessed presage
of a future glorious harvest in the kingdom of _Ireland_. Yet a little
while, and he that will come, shall come, and will not tarry. That your
soul may be filled with all the divine fulness, is the hearty prayer of,
dear Sir,

        Your affectionate friend and servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXXIX.


                         _To Governor B――――._

                                        _Portsmouth, April 27, 1750._

_Honoured Sir_,

I Wrote to your Excellency last from _Plymouth_, where, as well as in
many other places in the west, the LORD of all lords has been pleased
greatly to bless my poor unworthy ministrations. I am now (after having
seen much of the Redeemer’s power in _London_) making a short elopement
to _Portsmouth_, and from thence I purpose to go into the North, where
I trust thousands are already awakened to seek after the things which
lead to life eternal. The harvest in _England_ is exceeding great. I
know that your Excellency will pray, that the LORD of the harvest may
thrust out more labourers into his harvest. I am glad your Excellency
hath been honoured by providence, to put _New-Jersey_ college on
such a footing, that it may be a nursery for future labourers. I
have had the pleasure of seeing Mr. _A――――_ and Colonel _W――――_, and
have introduced them to such of my friends, as I believe, under GOD,
may serve the interest in which they are engaged. Glad shall I be of
every opportunity offered me, of promoting the Redeemer’s cause in
_New-England_ or _New-Jersey_. By the divine blessing, I hope that
something considerable will be done in _England_ and _Scotland_ for
_New-Jersey_ college. I wish your Excellency joy of the relation into
which I hear you have lately entered. I hope my dutiful respects will
find acceptance with Madam _Bel――――_, and I earnestly pray that you may
live together as heirs of the grace of life. May GOD honour you both
to bring forth much fruit in old age! Here I would end; but the love
I owe to the bearer, Mr. _S――――_, for CHRIST’s sake, constrains me to
recommend him to your Excellency. He is I think an _Israelite_ indeed.
I pray the LORD JESUS to succeed and bless him. He can give your
Excellency an account, how the work prospers on this side the water.
That every wilderness in _America_ may blossom like a rose, and that
your Excellency’s province may be like the garden of the LORD, is the
hearty prayer of,

      Your Excellency’s most dutiful but obliged humble servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCXXX.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. H――――._

                                        _Portsmouth, April 28, 1750._

_My very dear friend and Brother_,

YOUR letter should have had an immediate answer, if the least leisure
had offered when in town. But there I am continually hurried, and had
scarce time to eat bread. However, our LORD gave me meat which the
world knows not of, and enabled me to preach three or four times a day
to great multitudes, and I trust with great blessings. Fear not your
weak body; we are immortal till our work is done. CHRIST’s labourers
must live by miracle; if not, I must not live at all; for GOD only
knows what I daily endure. My continual vomitings almost kill me, and
yet the pulpit is my cure, so that my friends begin to pity me less,
and to leave off that ungrateful caution, “Spare thyself.” I speak this
to encourage you. Persons whose writings are to be blessings, must have
some thorns in the flesh. Your disorders, like mine, I believe are as
yet only to humble, not to kill us. Though I long to go to heaven, yet
I am apt to think we are not to die presently, but live and declare the
works of the LORD. You by your pen, I by my tongue. May the glorious
_Emmanuel_ bless us both! I believe he will. Courage, my dear, very
dear Mr. _H――――_; Courage. When we are weak, then are we strong.――But
to your letter. I am glad Dr. _S――――_ preaches, and that Mr. _H――――_,
is at work. In working we shall be blessed. To him that hath, shall
be given. How shall we contrive to meet. I purpose being at _Oulney_
next _Sunday_ sevennight, and in a day or two after at _Northampton_. I
wish I could have a line from you. In the mean while I shall endeavour
to get Dr. _W――――_. There is a glorious plan set on foot by the Great
and Good, for a college in the _New-Jersies_; the particulars will ere
long be published. I wish it much prosperity. Your Meditations are now
printing in _Philadelphia_. Why do you not sit for your picture?――The
seed sown here months ago, hath sprung up. People hear with great
attention. What cannot GOD do? The LORD be with you! I love you most
tenderly. I thank you ten thousand times for all favours, and am, very
dear friend,

            Yours most affectionately and eternally in our
                           dear LORD JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXXXI.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. D――――._

                                               _London, May 1, 1750._

_My very dear Friend_,

THOUGH I am somewhat fatigued with my journey, yet I cannot help
answering your very kind and wished-for letter. Blessed be the GOD and
Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, who delights to multiply his benefits
upon us! I wish you and dear Mrs. _D――――_ joy of your twins. May JESUS
sanctify them from the womb, and spare them with their tender mother,
to be lasting blessings to yourself and others! What shall I render
unto the LORD for removing prejudices from _Taunton_ people? It is
his doing; and the same grace was shewn at _Portsmouth_, from whence
I am just now come. I was there this time twelvemonth, and now had
the pleasure of hearing that many were then awakened, who hold on
their way. Thousands came to hear, and the word seemed to strike like
a pointed arrow. You have been misinformed about _Moor-fields_. I have
preached there twice lately to many thousands, but without molestation.
A blessed power attended the word, and we have had most delightful
seasons in _London_. Help me to cry Grace! grace! I am now going
Northward, and hope next week to have another interview with Messrs.
_H――――_, _H――――ly_, Dr. _D――――_, and Dr. _S――――_. I rejoice in the
success of the Doctor’s books, and pray the LORD earnestly to bless
all his labours more and more. Poor Lady _H――――n_ is ill. I say of
her, as I would to you, _serius in cœlum redeas_! You may direct to her
Ladyship at _Ashby-place_. I am glad to hear that your brethren begin
to envy you; It is a good sign. You have heard of the viper and the
file. Their biting will only make their own teeth to bleed. We are to
go on. I pray GOD you may, and increase with all the increase of GOD.
I salute you and all your family. My wife joins, very dear Mr. _D――――_,
with

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXXXII.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                                               _Ashby, May 11, 1750._

_Very dear Sir_,

AS you talked when I left _London_ of setting out on your journey in
about a fortnight, I cannot help sending you these few lines. I believe
they will be acceptable, because they acquaint you with the continuance
of the Redeemer’s loving kindness to the very chief of sinners. At
_Oulney_, where I preached last LORD’s day, we had two sweet seasons.
A great multitude attended, and I had the pleasure of seeing some, that
were wrought upon when I was there last. On the _Monday_, about six
miles from _Northampton_, I had a private interview with Dr. _S――――_,
Dr. _D――――_, Messrs. _H――――_ and _H――――ly_. On the _Tuesday_ I preached
in the morning to Dr. _D――――_’s family, and in the afternoon to above
two thousand in the field. Dr. _S――――_, Mr. _H――――_, &c. attended me,
and walked with me afterwards along the street; so that I hope the
physician will now turn his back on the world, and be content to follow
a despised crucified Redeemer without reserve. I expounded at his house
in the evening, and am hereafter to come to it as my own. On _Tuesday_
I preached twice at _Kettering_ to several thousands. The people gladly
received the word, and the Inn-keeper where I put up, I hope is a real
christian. On _Wednesday_ I came hither, and found good Lady _H――――_,
though very weak, yet better than I expected. I hope you will beg Mr.
_G――――_, and all GOD’s people, to strive together in their prayers, to
keep her out of heaven as long as they can, that she may do more good
on earth. I greet you and Mrs. _C――――_ most heartily, and wishing you
a very prosperous journey, by the will of GOD, I am, very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCXXXIII.


                          _To Doctor S――――._

                                               _Ashby, May 11, 1750._

_My Dear Doctor_,

HOW do you? I have thought of, and prayed for you much, since we
parted from _Northampton_. Now I believe is the time in which the ax is
to be laid at the very root of the tree. How wonderfully doth the LORD
JESUS watch over you? How sweetly does he lead you out of temptation!
O follow his leadings, my dear friend, and let every, even the most
beloved _Isaac_, be immediately sacrificed for GOD. Kindness is cruelty
here. Had _Abraham_ consulted either _Sarah_ or his affections, he
never would have taken the knife to slay his son. GOD’s law is our
rule, and GOD will have all the heart or none. _Agags_ will plead, but
they must be hewn in pieces. May the LORD strengthen, stablish, and
settle you! Good Lady _H――――n_ was much rejoiced to hear that you had
been without the camp. May you quit yourself like a man, and in every
respect behave like a good soldier of JESUS CHRIST! Her ladyship is
very weak, but I hope will yet be spared to do much good on earth. O
the happiness of giving up all for CHRIST, who hath given himself for
us. The LORD be with you!

                        I am yours to command,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXXXIV.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. M――――._

                                               _Ashby, May 14, 1750._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

I Have desired to write you a long letter for a considerable time, but
was so hurried when at _London_, that I could not be so explicit as the
affair I wanted to write about, necessarily required. It is concerning
the Presbyterian College in the _New Jersies_; the importance and
extensive usefulness of which, I suppose you have long since been
apprized of. Mr. _A――――_, a friend of Governor _B――――_, is come over
with a commission to negotiate this matter; he hath brought with him
a copy of a letter, which Mr. _P――――_ sent to you some months past.
This letter hath been shewn to Doctor _D――――_ and several of the
_London_ ministers, who all approve of the thing, and promise their
assistance. Last week I preached at _Northampton_, and conversed with
Doctor _D――――_ concerning it. The scheme that was then judged most
practicable was this, “That Mr. _P――――_’s letter should be printed, and
a recommendation of the affair, subscribed by Doctor _D――――_ and others,
be annexed; that a subscription and collections should be then set
on foot in _England_, and afterwards that Mr. _A――――_ should go to
_Scotland_.” I think it is an affair that requires dispatch. Governor
_B――――_ is old, but a most hearty man for promoting GOD’s glory, and
the good of mankind. He looks upon the college as his own daughter,
and will do all he can to endow her with proper privileges. The present
President Mr. _B――――_, and most of the Trustees, I am well acquainted
with. They are friends to vital piety, and I trust this work of the
LORD will prosper in their hands. The spreading of the gospel in
_Maryland_ and _Virginia_ in a great measure depends upon it, and
therefore I wish them much success in the name of the LORD. But more
of this when we meet. As I am going further northward, I know not but
I may go as far as _Glasgow_. Indeed there are so many doors opened
in _England_, that I know not well where to go first. I have lately
been in _Cornwall_, at _Portsmouth_, and _London_.――Since that I have
preached at _Oulney_, _Northampton_ and _Kettering_. For a few days I
have been at good Lady _H――――n_’s, who though weak in body, is always
abounding in the work of the LORD. She sends you her kind compliments,
and ordered me to beg the favour of you to acquaint Mr. _R――――_, that
she will answer his kind letter as soon as ever her strength will
permit. I preach daily at her Ladyship’s, and this week, GOD willing, I
shall preach in two or three churches. My bodily health is better than
usual, and I long to be on the stretch for Him, who was stretched upon
a cursed tree for ill and hell-deserving me. I beg a continued interest
in your prayers. I salute you and yours, Mr. _G――――_ and his wife, and
all dear friends, in the heartiest manner, and am, reverend and very
dear Sir,

                  Your most affectionate brother, &c.

                                               _Ashby, May 19, 1750._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

YOUR kind letter found me happy at our good Lady _H――――n_’s, whose
path shines more and more bright unto the perfect day. She is strangely
employed now.――Can you guess? The kind people of _Ashby_ stirred up
some of the baser sort to riot before her Ladyship’s door, while the
gospel was preaching; and on _Wednesday_ evening, some people in their
return home, narrowly escaped being murdered. Her Ladyship has just
received a message from the Justice, in order to bring the offenders
before him. I hope it will be over-ruled for great good, and that the
gospel for the future will have free course. This week I have preached
in three churches, and tomorrow morning, GOD willing, I am to preach
at a fourth. In the evening I shall preach at _Nottingham_, and purpose
lying at the house of Mr. _S――――_. Thus, reverend and dear Sir, you
see I lead a pilgrim life. Blessed be GOD, it is quite pleasant, and
I humbly intreat you to pray, that I may have a pilgrim heart, and be
kept from trimming or nestling even to my dying hour. I rejoice, dear
Sir, that you was blest at _Kettering_. Gladly shall I call upon you
again at _Northampton_, if the LORD spares my life; and in the mean
while shall not fail to pray, that the work of our common LORD may more
and more prosper in your hands. I thank you a thousand times for your
kindness to the very chief of sinners, and assure you, reverend Sir,
that the affection is reciprocal. Good Lady _H――――_ greatly esteems
you. I go with regret from her Ladyship. Her Ladyship intends writing
to you this evening. Do come and see her soon. I shall not be unmindful
of your sick student. May the LORD JESUS sanctify all pain, and through
his sufferings make him perfect. I would enlarge, but cannot. I write
in great haste, but with greater love subscribe myself, reverend and
dear Sir,

           Your most affectionate, obliged, though unworthy
            younger brother and servant, for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXXXVI.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                          _Nottingham, May 21, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

WITH regret I left your Ladyship; but I hope it was for the furtherance
of the gospel. At _Radcliff_ church, the divine influence was greater
than at _Millburn_. I preached on these words, “But one thing is
needful.” Many were impressed deeply. After sermon I conversed with Mrs.
_B――――_ and Mr. _Law_’s sister. The latter seems to be under awakenings,
and the former in her first love. She carries high sail; our LORD
knows how to put in proper ballast. In the morning I preached here to
many thousands. I had a great cold, but the LORD strengthened me. This
evening, GOD willing, I preach again, and to-morrow shall set off for
_Mansfield_, where a friend has invited me to his house. What care does
our LORD take of his poor pilgrims! As I go on, your Ladyship shall
hear how I am dealt with. I know it will be bountifully, because I have
got such a bountiful master. He will bless your Ladyship more and more.
When Mr. _B――――_ comes, I shall be glad to hear what becomes of the
rioters. A line may be sent to _Manchester_. O that your Ladyship may
live to see many of those _Ashby_ stones become children to _Abraham_!
I trust you will. I write in great haste, but with respect and
gratitude greater than I can express; and beg leave to subscribe myself,
very honoured Madam,

                         Your Ladyship’s, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCXXXVII.


                            _To Dr. S――――._

                                           _Mansfield, May 24, 1750._

_My dear Doctor_,

YOURS found me just as I was about to leave good Lady _H――――_. Ever
since, I have been engaged in travelling and preaching the everlasting
gospel. In _Radcliff_ church, at _Nottingham_, and _Sutton_, our LORD’s
Spirit hath accompanied the word preached. This morning I preached here,
and, GOD willing, purpose to do so again in the evening, and to-morrow
morning. Little was expected here but rudeness; however the auditory
was large and attentive. What cannot the Redeemer do? I am quite sorry
that Mr. _H――――_’s letter was printed:――But it was no Methodist that
published it. _Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum._ I pray GOD
to give my dear friend prudence and courage whilst he is in _London_.
Remember, if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off;――if thy right
eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee. Now is your time
to sacrifice your _Isaac_. CHRIST will have all the heart or none. I
write thus, because I love you dearly. I pray for you from my inmost
soul. O that you may be kept as in a garrison, by GOD’s mighty power,
through faith unto salvation! Without CHRIST you can do nothing. _Nil
desperandum Christo duce._ That he may strengthen you to do what you
know to be his will, is the hearty prayer of, very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCXXXVIII.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                           _Mansfield, May 14, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Beg leave on my journey, to trouble your Ladyship with a few lines.
They bring your Ladyship good news. I have been quite sick ever since I
have left _Ashby_; but the glorious _Emmanuel_ has been pleased to work
by my unworthy ministry. At _Nottingham_ several came to me, enquiring
what they should do to be saved. I preached there four times. One
evening Lord _S――――_ and several gentlemen were present, and behaved
with great decency. Many thousands attended. Yesterday morning I
breakfasted with three dissenting ministers and Mr. _P――――_’s, who told
me that Lady _P――――_ desired he would press me to preach at _B――――_
church. Yesterday in the afternoon I preached at _Sutton_, and this
morning I lifted up the gospel standard here. All was quiet; and this
evening and to-morrow morning I am to preach again. As I travel on,
your Ladyship shall hear. I must lie down to refresh this weary body:
my soul, through grace, smiles at bodily weakness, and longs to take
its flight. I doubt not but your Ladyship is happy in him, who alone
killeth and maketh alive. Night and day do I look up to him in behalf
of your Ladyship, as being, ever-honoured Madam,

         Your Ladyship’s most obedient, obliged, and chearful
                      Servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXXXIX.


                       _To the Countess D――――._

                                               _Leeds, May 30, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Heard about a week ago, that your Ladyship was exceeding ill. I have
been much concerned ever since, and have attempted to write more than
once, but travelling and preaching twice a day prevented me. Ere now
I trust the great physician has rebuked your Ladyship’s indisposition,
and given you to rejoice in his great salvation. If not, his grace will
be sufficient for you. He will not suffer you to be tempted above what
you are able to bear, but will with the temptation make a way for you
to escape. Sanctified afflictions are signs of his especial love. Love
holds the rod, love strikes, love wounds, and love heals again. “Strike,
LORD; (says _Luther_) now I know thou art my father.”――And, says that
sweet singer Mr. _Mason_,

                _―――― O happy rod,_
                _That brought me nearer to my GOD._

This, I believe, will be the language of your Ladyship’s heart. Look,
therefore, honoured Madam, to JESUS, the author and finisher of your
faith. In all your afflictions, he is afflicted. He will bring you out
of this furnace, like gold purified seven times in the fire. Good Lady
_H――――_ is weak too, but I trust will yet live to declare the works of
the LORD. _Ashby_ is not worthy of so rich a pearl. Was I not afraid of
hurting your Ladyship, I would give you some particulars of my circuit.
Let it suffice to inform your Ladyship, that the gospel plough seems
to prosper. New ground has been broken up, and seed sown, that I trust
will bear fruit to life eternal. I am here amongst a multitude of
souls that seem to love the LORD JESUS in sincerity. To-morrow I move
_Northward_; and if I hear that your Ladyship is recovered, I shall
take the freedom of writing now and then. I purpose sending a few lines
also to Lady _F――――_ and Lady _H――――_. All were constantly remembered
at _Ashby_ at the holy table. All shall still be remembered, as our
LORD enables, by, honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most obliged and ready servant,
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCXL.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                               _Leeds, May 30, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Cannot travel far without sitting down to refresh myself by writing
to your Ladyship. _Mansfield_ I hope was taken. After leaving that
place, I went to _Rotheram_, where _Satan_ rallied his forces again.
However, I preached twice, on the _Friday_ evening, and _Saturday_
morning. The cryer was employed to give notice of a bear-baiting. Your
Ladyship may guess who was the _Bear_. About seven in the morning the
drum was heard, and several watermen attended it with great staves.
The constable was struck, and two of the mobbers were apprehended, but
rescued afterwards. But all this does not come up to the kind usage
of the people of _Ashby_. I preached on those words, “Fear not, little
flock.”――They were both fed and feasted; and after a short stay I left
_Rotheram_, when I knew it was become more pacific. In the evening I
preached at _Sheffield_, where the people received the word gladly. A
very great alteration was discernable in their looks since I was there
last. On _Sunday_ great multitudes attended, and in the evening many
went away that could not come near enough to hear. On _Monday_ we had a
parting blessing; and in the evening the LORD JESUS fed us plentifully,
with the bread that cometh down from heaven, at _Barly-Hall_. Last
night I preached to many, many thousands, and this morning also at five
o’clock. Methinks I am now got into another climate. It must be a warm
one, where there are so many of GOD’s people. Our Pentecost is to be
kept at Mr. _G――――_’s. I have seen him and Mr. _J――――_, and hear that
Mr. _B――――_ died comfortably, being fully assured, “That not only all
his sins before, but after conversion were forgiven him.” To-morrow,
GOD willing, I move hence, and expect to-morrow evening to see Mrs.
_H――――_, and to reach _Manchester_ next week. From thence I purpose
writing to your Ladyship again. O that any thing I write, say, or do,
may afford the least comfort to your Ladyship’s soul! This is my desire
and hearty prayer: and I earnestly entreat the LORD, that you may live
long, and prosper in soul and body. I send my usual and most dutiful
respects to the honourable ladies, and am ever, honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most obliged and ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCXLI.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                          _Manchester, June 8, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Thought to have troubled your Ladyship with a letter long before this
time, but travelling, and preaching twice every day, prevented. Blessed
be GOD, it is pleasant work, and I trust it hath prospered in my
unworthy hands. Thousands and thousands for some time past have flocked
to hear the word twice every day, and the power of GOD has attended it
in a glorious manner. Good Lady _H――――n_ I left some time ago weak in
body, but strong in the grace which is in CHRIST JESUS. The good people
of _Ashby_ were so kind as to mob round her Ladyship’s door, whilst
the gospel was preaching. Alas! how great and irreconcileable is the
enmity of the serpent! This is my comfort, “The seed of the woman shall
at length be more than conqueror over all.” I hope that your Ladyship
every day experiences more and more of this conquest in your heart.
This is the christian’s daily employ; this the believer’s daily triumph,
to die to self and sin, and to rise more and more daily into the image
of the blessed JESUS. As it is our duty, so it is our unspeakable
privilege. All the crosses we meet with, all the afflictions with which
we are visited, are all intended by the good physician, to beat down,
and keep under, and weaken the old man, and to raise up, strengthen,
and give fresh vigour to the new man, which is created after GOD in
righteousness and true holiness. Our business is to look continually
to JESUS, and to lean on him hourly, nay every moment. May this be your
Ladyship’s continual employ! May the LORD JESUS strengthen, stablish,
and settle you more and more in his love. May he give you to see your
honoured Relations partakers of a divine nature in this world, and
grant you mansions of eternal bliss in the world to come! No less
mercies shall, no greater can be desired for your Ladyship and family
by, honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most obliged and ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXLII.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                             _Rosindale (Lancashire), June 14, 1750._

_Very dear Sir_,

EVER since that I heard your journey into the country was deferred, I
have been impatient to write you a line. Till now, I cannot say I have
had a proper opportunity. Travelling, and preaching twice a day, as
I generally do, is almost too much for my frail tabernacle. But he is
faithful who hath promised, “That as our day is, so our strength shall
be.” Though faint, I am yet pursuing, and, glory be to GOD, hitherto
I have had a most delightful and successful circuit. I suppose you
have heard of my reception at _Northampton_ and _Ashby_, and of that
people’s unkind treatment of good Lady _H――――_. At _Nottingham_ I
lodged with Mr. _S――――_, and in that place and several others found
great success. In _Yorkshire_ the work hath advanced most. In about a
week’s time, within the compass of twenty miles, I preached, I believe,
to above six thousand souls. This last week I have been beating up
for recruits in and about _Manchester_, and I trust some have listed.
Mrs. _G――――_ behaves like a good soldier; and if I am not mistaken, her
husband will follow her good example. I am now going towards _Kendal_,
then to _Whitehaven_, and it may be to _Scotland_. I know you will pray,
that the hand of the LORD may be with me. That is all in all! I hope
this will find my dear friend quite busy for his GOD, even his GOD
in CHRIST. We have not a moment to be idle here; the Judge is before
the door. I want to have my lamp trimmed, and my loins girt, and to be
always habitually and actually ready to meet the blessed Bridegroom.
Then do we begin to live like ourselves, and to act like those who are
redeemed unto GOD by the precious blood of JESUS CHRIST, and made kings
and priests unto GOD and his Father; to him be glory and dominion now
and for evermore. My dear Sir, my cold heart is warmed when I think
of this. O why am I not a flame of fire? Why am I not all life, all
love, all humility, all zeal? O my naughty heart! May JESUS sprinkle
it afresh with his precious blood, and help me this morning to begin
to hunt for souls. Though aged, I wish you may be employed in the same
work before you die. But future things belong to GOD. I must now bid
you adieu. My cordial love and respects await Mrs. _C――――_, Mr. _G――――_,
and all enquiring friends. Continue to pray for, very dear Sir,

      Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_Honoured Madam_,

IT is late, and I am somewhat fatigued, but I cannot rest without
finishing my week’s work in writing to your Ladyship. Blessed be GOD,
I have still good news to send to your Ladyship. All was quiet at
_Manchester_; and I humbly hope the Redeemer will gather to himself
a people there. Kind Captain _G――――_ and his lady will acquaint your
Ladyship with particulars. I hope he will prove a good soldier of JESUS
CHRIST. I advised him to send your Ladyship word of their coming to
_Ashby_, that they might be directed the best road from _Derby_. We had
sweet seasons at the places adjacent to _Manchester_. Only at _♦Bolton_
a drunkard stood up to preach behind me, and a woman attempted twice to
stab the person that was putting up a stand for me to preach on, in her
husband’s field. However, the LORD got himself the victory. Since that,
we have had very large and powerful meetings, where formerly were the
most violent outrages. Perhaps within these three weeks, sixty-thousand
souls or upwards have heard the gospel. I am now in Mr. _J――――_’s
circuit, and purpose being at _Kendal_ next _Thursday_. I hope that
there, or at _Whitehaven_, where I am to preach to-morrow se’nnight,
I shall hear from Mr. _B――――_ concerning your Ladyship’s welfare.――His
letter I received to-night, and will answer it the first opportunity.
Nature now calls for rest. I shall retire, praying that your Ladyship
and honoured relations may be blessed with all spiritual blessings. I
am a sink of sin and corruption; but JESUS comforts and supports me,
and, I believe, will hear your Ladyship’s prayers in behalf of one,
who, next to being a poor despised minister of the glorious _Emmanuel_,
thinks it his highest honour to subscribe himself,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and very
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

_Honored Madam_,

barn and stable, and have cut my chaise, and one of the horse’s tails.
What would men do, if they could? The LORD be with your spirit. _Amen._

                                             _Kendal, June 21, 1750._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

I Guess this will find you returned from good Lady _H――――n_, with whom
undoubtedly you have taken sweet counsel, and been mightily refreshed
in talking about the things which belong to the kingdom of GOD.
This leaves me at _Kendal_, where I arrived this morning, and where,
GOD willing, I shall preach the everlasting gospel this evening. An
entrance is now made into _Westmoreland_; and pen cannot well describe
what glorious scenes have opened in _Yorkshire_, &c. Perhaps since I
saw you, seventy or eighty thousand have attended the word preached
in divers places. At _Howarth_, on _Whitsunday_, the church was almost
thrice filled with communicants, and at _Kirby-Steven_ the people
behaved exceedingly well. It was a precious season. In my way I have
read Mr. _Law_’s second part of _The Spirit of Prayer_. His scheme
about the Fall, &c. I think is quite chimerical; but he says many
things that are truly noble, and which I pray GOD to write upon the
tables of my heart. Several things at the end of his treatise on
regeneration, in my opinion, are entirely unjustifiable: but the sun
hath its spots, and so have the best of men. I want to see my own
faults more, and others less. It will be so, when I am more humble. If
mercies would make a creature humble, I should be a mirror of humility.
But I am far from the mind that was in JESUS. You must pray, whilst
I go on fighting. Though faint, I would yet pursue. Next week I hope
to reach _Edinburgh_. GOD willing, you shall have notice of my return.
Glad shall I be to meet such a friend upon the road. May the friend of
sinners bless and support you, and give you always an heart to pray for,
reverend and very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

                                             _Kendal, June 21, 1750._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

ON _Saturday_ last I received your kind letter, but have not had an
opportunity of answering it till now. I have been preaching the gospel
amongst the poor knitters, whose simple manner of life pleased me much.
I am glad you have sounded the silver trumpet in _London_; _crescit
eundo_ must be your motto, and mine. There is nothing like keeping
the wheels oil’d by action. The more we do, the more we may do; every
act strengthens the habit: and the best preparation for preaching on
_Sundays_, is to preach every day in the week. I am glad you have peace
at _Ashby_. What a fool is Satan always to overshoot his mark! I hope
that Mr. _G――――_, as well as Mr. _S――――_, will hold on. They will be
glorious monuments of free grace indeed. I am like-minded with you in
respect to the Doctor’s comment; he is indeed a glorious writer. May
the LORD JESUS strengthen him to finish the work! My dear Mr. _B――――_,
what blessed opportunities do you enjoy for meditation, study, and
prayer! Now is your time to get rich in grace, to search into the
depths of divine love, and the mystery of iniquity hid in your own
heart. Such an example, and such advantages no one in _England_ is
favoured with but yourself. I do not envy you; but I pray the Redeemer,
from my inmost soul, to sanctify your situation, and give you to
increase with all the increase of GOD. I am called forth to battle;
remember a poor cowardly soldier, and beg the Captain of our salvation,
that I may have the honour to die fighting. I would have all my fears
in my breast. Methinks I would not be wounded running away, or skulking
into an hiding-place. It is not for ministers of CHRIST to flee or be
afraid.――And yet alas!――Well――_Nil desperandum Christo duce_. For his
great name’s sake, I subscribe myself, reverend and very dear Sir,

          Your most affectionate, obliged friend and brother,
                                                              _G. W._

_Honoured Madam_,

STILL (O amazing love!) the LORD of all lords vouchsafes to prosper the
gospel plough. Such an entrance hath been made into _Kendal_, as could
not have been expected. I preached twice to several thousands last week,
and the people were so importunate, that I was prevailed on to return
hither again last night. The congregation was greatly increased, and
the power of the LORD was displayed in the midst of them. On _Saturday_
evening, and on the Lord’s-day, I preached at _Ulverston_, a town about
sixteen miles distant from this. There Satan made some small resistance;
a clergyman, who looked more like a butcher than a minister, came with
two others and charged a constable with me; but I never saw a poor
creature sent off in such disgrace. Good I believe was done in the
town. To the giver of every good gift be all the glory! Thus, honoured
Madam, a poor pilgrim goes on. How I am to succeed at _Whitehaven_,
your Ladyship shall know hereafter. GOD willing, I set forward after
preaching this evening. I hear Mr. _W――――_ has been much abused in
_Ireland_, but that the Mayor of _Cork_ hath quite overshot himself. I
have some thoughts of seeing _Ireland_ before my return. May the LORD
direct my goings in his way! I am persuaded that this will find your
Ladyship travelling apace towards _Canaan_, and increasing your reward
daily. Great shall it be indeed in heaven.――I shall be extremely glad
of the honour of a line when at _Edinburgh_. In the mean while, your
Ladyship shall not fail, with your honoured sisters and family, of
being prayed for, and hearing from, ever-honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and very
                  chearful servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXLVII.


                            _To Mr. K――――._

                                             _Kendal, June 26, 1750._

_My dear Mr. K――――_,

YESTERDAY I read in the public papers, that you was married. This
morning I sit down to wish you joy. GOD hath given you, a choice
help-mate. May you love her as JESUS CHRIST loveth the church; and may
both of you be enabled to live together as heirs of the grace of life!
The LORD of all lords has been daily pouring down his benefits on you
and me. O that his goodness may lead us to repentance, and his love
constrain us to obedience! You have now another blessing given you; one
who, I believe, will strengthen your hands in the LORD, and stir you up
in the good ways of GOD. Now for _Joshua_’s resolution, “As for me and
my house, we will serve the LORD.” You are now entered on a new state;
you will want new supplies of grace. It is hard to govern; it is much
easier to obey. To come into a flow of business, and at the same time
to keep the heart near to GOD, what a task is this? JESUS alone can
make you sufficient for it. Look then, my dear friend, continually to
him, and take heed that nothing drowns the sound of this small still
voice speaking in your heart. When I come to town, GOD willing, I will
pay you a visit. In the mean while let us meet at the throne of grace.
I am travelling, and you trading, for JESUS CHRIST. His strength is
my joy. Every where the gospel plough hath prospered. These _Northern_
parts promise well. Adieu! The LORD be with you both! Pray remember me
in the kindest manner to your mother and brothers. You are come into a
family that I dearly love. That you all may sit down with the glorious
family of the first-born, whole names are written in heaven, is the
earnest prayer of, my dear friend,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCXLVIII.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                         _Whitehaven, June 29, 1750._

_My dear Mr. B――――_,

YESTERDAY, upon my arrival hither, I received your kind letter, and
am now seated to send you an answer. May the LORD JESUS cause it to be
answer of peace! You need make no apology for your openness and freedom;
reserves to me are odious. I would willingly be a father, brother, and
friend to all concerned with me; and consequently I would gladly bear
a part with them in their sorrows and their joys. Your suspicions about
Messrs. _S――――_, _G――――_, and _N――――_, were groundless. The sole cause
of your not hearing from me, was my not knowing where to direct to
you. As I am utterly unconcerned in the discipline of Mr. _W――――_’s
societies, I can be no competent judge of their affairs. If you and the
rest of the preachers were to meet together more frequently, and tell
each other your grievances, opinions, &c. it might be of service. This
may be done in a very friendly way, and thereby many uneasinesses might
be prevented. After all, those that will live in peace must agree to
disagree in many things with their fellow-labourers, and not let little
things part or disunite them. I know not well, what my dear Mr. _B――――_
means, about concealing the gospel privileges. There is no doubt but
milk must be given to babes, and meat to strong men; but this all
depends on the skilfulness of the preacher, and his being taught of
GOD rightly to divide the word of truth. In general, gospel privileges
may be spoken of to encourage awakened sinners and quicken saints.
If by gospel privileges you mean _love-feasts_, _bands_, &c. these I
think are only prudential means, and therefore no doubt prudence should
be exercised in the use of them. I am of your opinion, that too much
familiarity in these things is hurtful. But it is hard to keep a medium,
where a multitude is concerned. As ill effects are discovered, they
should be corrected and avoided. The question and answer you refer to,
I do not like. I know nothing of CHRIST’s righteousness being imputed
to all mankind. It is enough to say with the scriptures, “That it is
imputed to all believers.” What does my dear Mr. _B――――_ think of that
assertion of the Apostle, “He made him sin for us, who knew no sin,
that we might be made the righteousness of GOD, in him.” And again,
“Who of GOD is made to us, wisdom, righteousness, &c.” _cum multis
aliis_, vide Romans, ivth and vith.――Is it not as express as can be,
that CHRIST’s righteousness is imputed to believers? Consequently, it
is sufficient for us, as preachers, to declare, “That all believers are
actually delivered from the guilt of both actual and original sin, from
the power of their corruptions here, and that at the hour of death they
shall be delivered from the very in-being of sin, and be admitted to
dwell with the glorious JESUS, and the spirits of just men made perfect,
hereafter.” Another seven years experience, will teach some to handle
the word of life in a better manner. Our business is to shew believers
their compleatness in CHRIST, and to point them to Him for strength for
every good word and work; and all to be done out of gratitude and love
for what he hath done and suffered for them. But you know my sentiments;
you have heard them all in my sermons. I have no reserves. What Mr.
_S――――_ says, I know not; I believe CHRIST’s redemption will be applied
to all that shall believe. Who these are, we know not, and therefore
we are to give a general offer and invitation; convinced of this, that
every man’s damnation is of himself, and every man’s salvation all of
GOD. You would do well to read more; but whether it would be best for
you to pursue, or re-assume your old studies, unless you are determined
to settle, I cannot tell. Reading a _Latin_ author, a little every day,
to be sure could do you no hurt. _Terentius Christianus_, _Castalio_’s
Scripture Dialogues, and _Selectæ Prælectiones Veteri Testamenti_,
would both delight and profit you. It has long since been my judgment,
that it would be best for many of the present preachers to have a tutor,
and retire for a while, and be content with preaching now and then,
till they were a little more improved. Otherwise, I fear many who now
make a temporary figure, for want of a proper foundation, will run
themselves out of breath, will grow weary of the work, and leave it.
May the LORD JESUS direct! This is the plan I purpose to pursue abroad.
Whether GOD will be pleased to succeed it, I know not. All I can say is,
that I am willing to lend an helping hand wherever I see the interest
of CHRIST promoted. This is my motive, dear Sir, in answering your last.
I hope it is satisfactory. If not, let me know. You may direct for me
at Mr. _T――――_’s, _Edinburgh_. I hope to be there next week. We have
had good seasons since I parted from you. At _Kendal_ a most promising
door is opened. Follow me with your prayers.――Look up to JESUS, and
let not little things disappoint and move you. If this be your foible,
beware, and pray that Satan may not get an advantage over you. He will
be always striving to vex and unhinge you. “The LORD reigneth.” Let
this consideration support and comfort you, under the various changes
you must necessarily meet with in the church. She is now militant, ere
long she shall be triumphant. Till then, as the elect of GOD, let us
put on bowels of compassion, meekness, long-suffering and humbleness of
mind. But what am I doing? Adieu. The LORD be with you and yours, and
give Mrs. _B――――_ faith and courage in her approaching hour! All with
me salute you. I must hasten to subscribe myself, my dear Mr. _B――――_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXLIX.


                         _To Mr. T―――― A――――._

                                           _Edinburgh, July 7, 1750._

_Very dear T――――_,

I Thought it long, yea very long since I heard from you; but as I
believe your heart is upright towards the LORD JESUS, and to me your
unworthy friend, for his great name’s sake, I have been quite easy. The
news of your success, rejoices me. May the LORD increase it more and
more! Pen cannot well express what hath been done in the North. I have
preached above ninety times since I left _London_, and perhaps to a
hundred and forty thousand people. It is amazing to see how people
are prepared, in places where I never was before. What shall I render
unto the LORD? I will beg him to make me humble and thankful. Here, I
am received with as much affection as ever. Still I will cry, Grace!
grace! Ere this reaches you, I suppose you will be thinking of _London_.
Mr. _C――――_ I believe wants a breathing. I hear he hath been blest
much. You and Mr. _C――――_ are the only persons I chuse to have at the
tabernacle, as heads in my absence. Several of ―――― have offered to
join me; but you know I hate taking other persons as helpers, and as I
desire no party, I give no encouragement. But future things belong to
Him, on whose shoulders the government is put. You must still remember
me before Him. His word is indeed running, and like to be glorified day
by day. How matters go on here, you will know hereafter. In the mean
while pray for, and write to, my very dear _Tommy_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCCL.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                           _Edinburgh, July 7, 1750._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

AFTER preaching at _Cockermouth_, and near _Wigton_, with great
acceptance, last night I came here, and was received in a most loving
and tender manner. At noon, I dined with a family that honours your
Ladyship very much, and this evening I have been preaching to a great
multitude of very attentive and affected hearers. At my return to my
lodgings, I had the wished-for pleasure of your Ladyship’s two letters.
They both led me nearer to, and laid me lower before Him, at whose
throne I am daily pleading for the welfare of your Ladyship, both
in temporals and spirituals. Indeed, ever honoured Madam, I have
confidence with you that your Ladyship shall have all the deliverance
you long for. By divine grace, I will let the LORD have no rest, till
he fulfils all your desires. I quite forget myself, when I think of
your Ladyship. Ever honoured Madam, the LORD as yet hath but begun to
bless you; you shall, you shall, you will be made a greater blessing
indeed. If dear Mr. _H――――_ gets _A――――y_, that will be making your
Ladyship a blessing. He is a dear soul; I am glad that both he and
Dr. _D――――_ have been with your Ladyship. I would have all the good
ministers come and visit your Ladyship. There are numbers would go
scores of miles willingly for that purpose. I hope soon to send your
Ladyship some pleasing particulars. I have heard from my family. May
the blessing of many ready to perish descend on your Ladyship. I pity
poor _A―――― B――――_. Your Ladyship I believe will soon get the better of
him. Your Ladyship hath acted like yourself in forgiving the offenders.
Such offences come, that CHRIST’s followers may give evidence of his
blessed temper being wrought in their hearts. In my return, without
fail your Ladyship may expect me at ungrateful _Ashby_. Out of those
stones may the LORD JESUS raise up children unto _Abraham_! However
GOD is pleased to deal with me, your Ladyship may be assured of hearing
from me. In the mean while, your Ladyship and honoured relations and
family will be continually remembered by, ever-honoured Madam,

         Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, ready, obliged, though
                  unworthy servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCLI.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                          _Edinburgh, July 12, 1750._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

THOUGH I am really burning with a fever, and have a violent cold, yet I
must send your Ladyship a few lines by this post. They bring good news.
People flock rather more than ever, and earnestly entreat me not to
leave them soon. I preach generally twice a day,――early in the morning,
and at six in the evening. Great multitudes attend. Praise the LORD O
my soul! Your Ladyship’s health is drank and enquired after every day.
Mr. _N――――_, who married Lord ――――’s sister, has given me three franks,
and his family are in the number of those who are left in _Sardis_, and
have not defiled their garments. Enclosed your Ladyship hath my last
from _Carolina_, and an account of the affair mentioned by the Bishop
of _Cork_. I fear I cannot reach _Ireland_ this season. Your Ladyship’s
message to Mr. _Robe_, I sent last post; he will think himself highly
honoured. Some time next month I hope to see your Ladyship. In the mean
time, whether sick or well, your Ladyship shall be sure to hear how
the LORD of all Lords is pleased to deal with me and his people. His
presence makes me to smile at pain, and the fire of his love burns up
all fevers whatsoever. This your Ladyship knows by happy experience.
That you may know it more and more every hour, and every moment, is the
continual prayer of, honoured Madam,

          Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged and chearful
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCLII.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                                            _Glasgow, July 21, 1750._

_Dear Jemmy_,

I Have nothing but good news to send you. The entrance GOD has been
pleased to give me into _Scotland_, demands the highest tribute
of gratitude and love. I preached twenty times at _Edinburgh_, and
thousands attended morning and evening. Many I hope got good. To the
giver of every good gift be all the glory! Last night I came hither,
and was most lovingly received, and this morning the LORD of all Lords
hath given us a delightful meeting. Blessed news is sent from _Kendal_.
Enclosed you have the marks of my friends bounty, who love me for JESUS
sake. Be pleased to receive the bill, and as you live near Mr. _S――――_,
be so kind as to pay him the remainder of what is due for printing my
last sermons. Take his accompt, and a receipt under; what is left, pray
give to my wife to pay _Wr――――_ the book-binder. For I would fain owe
no man any thing but love.――I would have my worldly affairs so ordered,
that let death come when it will, I may have nothing to do but to die.
That is a blessed word to me; the thoughts of death gladden my heart,
and cause me often almost to leap for joy. But perhaps our LORD has
more work for me to do. His will be done in, by, and upon me, in time,
and to all eternity. Pilgrims must not expect much rest here. In heaven
we shall have enough. There I shall meet you and yours. I salute you
both most tenderly, and beg you would all pray for, my dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLIII.


                            _To Mr. R――――._

                                            _Glasgow, July 23, 1750._

_My very dear Friend_,

WITH pleasure I sit down to perform my promise, and to thank you for
all favours. The LORD is still adding to my obligations, to love and
serve him. Friends here received me most kindly, and the congregations
I think are rather larger than ever. Yesterday, besides preaching twice
in the field, I preached in the college _Kirk_, being forced by Mr.
_G――――_. ’Twas a blessed season. Mr. _R――――_ and Mr. _E――――_ were very
affectionate. I have met, and shaken hands with Mr. _R―――― E――――_. O
when shall GOD’s people learn war no more! GOD willing, I shall leave
_Glasgow_ on _Thursday_ next, and if you please, will sup quietly with
you and your lady, or with Mr. _G――――_, on _Friday_ evening. I hope
to be in early, because I intend lying at Mr. _E――――_’s house, or at
_Kylsyth_ on the _Thursday_. Letters this post make me resolve not
to visit _Ireland_ this summer; Mr. _W――――_ is there, and persecution
increases. I send the inclosed open. A copy might be put into my wife’s,
lest the other should miscarry. My stay in _Edinburgh_ at my return
must be very short. May the LORD JESUS make it sweet! You must remember
me in the kindest manner to your dear lady, the other ladies, and all
enquiring friends, and accept of most hearty love from, my very dear
Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCLIV.


                            _To Mr. W――――._

                                            _Glasgow, July 23, 1750._

_Dear Sir_,

I Received your kind letter last week, but till now had not time to
answer you. Blessed be GOD, it brought glad tidings. Thanks be to the
ever-loving ever-lovely JESUS, for causing his arrows to stick fast
in any sinners hearts! May he that hath wounded, in his own due time
and way heal and ease them!――He is the awakened sinners only refuge.
To Him the weary and heavy laden are invited. Let them but come to
him, and he will, indeed he will give them rest. O that those who have
begun to put their hands to the plough, may be kept from looking back!
Awakening times are like spring times. Many blossoms, but not always
so much fruit. However, glory, glory be to GOD, that the Winter of
deadness is in some degree over, and that a Spring time of grace is
seen at _Kendal_. Pray remember me in the kindest manner to all under
awakenings, and exhort them all with full purpose of heart to cleave
unto the LORD. Whether I can see you again in my return, is uncertain.
If it be any way practicable, I shall comply with your earnest
solicitation. Next week, GOD willing, I leave _Scotland_, and if I can
come, you shall hear from me. In the mean time, as the LORD enables, I
shall not cease to pray for all that are setting their faces Zionward.
You know the many turnings that lie in the way thither, and therefore
can direct young travellers. It is pretty work for you in the decline
of life. Methinks you may be surprized like _Sarah_, who said, “who
would have thought that _Sarah_ should have given suck!” But is there
any thing too hard for the LORD? O for faith, patience and humility!
These are graces my soul thirsts after. How humble, how thankful ought
I to be! After leaving _Kendal_, the word of the LORD ran and was
glorified in several places, and in _Scotland_ I think congregations
are rather greater than ever. You must exhort all to pray for me, that
I may be kept from flagging in the latter stages of my road. My love
to Mr. _G――――_. I shall take care to answer his letter when it comes to
hand. I have ordered some volumes of my sermons to be sent to him. May
GOD sanctify the reading of them to the carrying on his blessed work. I
can now no more. The LORD be with you. I am, dear Sir,

                      Yours, &c. in JESUS CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCLV.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                          _Edinburgh, July 29, 1750._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

WHAT shall I say? Your Ladyship’s condescension in writing to unworthy
me, lays me low before Him, who continues to follow me with his
goodness and mercy every hour of my life. Ungrateful _Ashby_! O that
thou knewest the day of thy visitation! Surely your Ladyship may shake
off the dust of your feet against them. This was the command, that
the meek and lowly JESUS gave to his apostles, when the gospel was not
received. And he himself departed, when the _Gadarenes_ desired him
to go out of their coasts. This justifies your Ladyship in removing Mr.
_B――――_. What avails throwing pearls before swine, who only turn again
and rend you? However, I bless GOD that your Ladyship’s house is made
a _Bethel_. Glad would I be of the honour of joining your Ladyship’s
little select company, but our Redeemer appoints me other work.――Indeed
it is very pleasant work. No one can well describe the order, attention,
and earnestness of the _Scotch_ congregations. They are unwearied in
hearing the gospel. I left thousands sorrowful at _Glasgow_, and here
I was again most gladly received last night. By preaching always twice,
and once thrice, and once four times in a day, I am quite weakened; but
I hope to recruit again, and get fresh strength to work for Him, who
shed his precious blood for ill and hell-deserving me. On _Thursday_
next, GOD willing, I shall leave _Scotland_. Your Ladyship shall know
whither I go. In the mean while, I send your Ladyship some _Georgia_
letters, which I hope will afford you satisfaction. I have been upon
the enquiry for some proper persons, for dear Captain _G――――_ and
his Lady to converse with at _Dumfries_, and last night I hear I have
succeeded. Particulars they shall know hereafter. I can now only send
them my most grateful and cordial respects, being obliged to stop to
get strength even whilst I write this. O this mortal body! How does it
weigh down my precious and immortal soul! Ere long it will be set at
liberty, and body and soul shall be for ever with the LORD. I cannot
enlarge. Your Ladyship is remembered every day by many here. I hope
your Ladyship’s honoured sisters are prospering in soul and body. The
searcher of hearts can tell how much I count it my honour to subscribe
myself, ever-honoured Madam,

          Their and your most obliged, dutiful, and chearful
                   servant for JESUS CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCLVI.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                             _Berwick, Aug. 4, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

AT length I have taken a very sorrowful leave of _Scotland_. The
longer I continued there, the more the congregations, and the power
that attended the word, increased. I have reason to think that many
are under convictions, and am assured of hundreds having received great
benefit and consolation. The parting was rather more affectionate than
ever, and I shall have reason to bless GOD to all eternity for this
last visit to _Scotland_. Not a dog moved his tongue all the while I
was there, and many enemies where glad to be at peace with me. Who is
like our GOD, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, continually
doing wonders! Preaching so frequently, and paying so many religious
visits, weakened me very much; but I am already much better for
my riding thus far, and I trust the LORD will cause me to renew my
strength. My obligations to spend and be spent for the blessed JESUS,
are greatly increased. O that I may spring afresh, and soar aloft till
I fly into the embraces of a sin-forgiving GOD! He hath prepared my
way at _Berwick_. One of the ministers hath sent me an offer of his
pulpit, and I hear of about ten more round this town that would do the
same. I came hither this evening, and purpose, GOD willing, to set out
for _Newcastle_ on _Monday_ morning. What success I meet with, your
Ladyship shall hear in my next. Was it not so late in the year, I think
I would go to _Ireland_. May the LORD direct my goings in his way!
_Kendal_, I believe, must have another visit. The enclosed is from one
of Mr. _W――――_’s preachers. The contents I believe will please your
Ladyship. Honoured Madam, what shall I say? The Redeemer’s goodness
quite amazes me. “Less than the least of all,” shall be my motto
still. With regret, I send your Ladyship Mr. _H――――_’s too, too much
embellished and extravagant character of ill and hell-deserving me.
It came from _Plymouth_ last post. Your Ladyship desired to see it, or
otherwise I could not bear to send it. To me, O blessed JESUS, nothing
belongs, but shame and confusion of face. O that praise as well as
contempt may humble this proud heart of mine! Then I shall never be
hurt by having the honour to subscribe myself, honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and very
                   ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLVII.


                            _To Mr. L――――._

                                           _Newcastle, Aug. 9, 1750._

_My dear dying Friend_,

THOUGH absent in body, yet I am present with you in spirit; and whilst
you are in this tabernacle of clay, as our LORD enables, you shall
not be forgotten before his throne. Ere long you will be called to sit
upon it; JESUS himself will rise and take you in.――And why? He hath
redeemed you unto GOD by his blood, and given you the first fruits of
heaven already in your heart. Fear not therefore, my dear friend, to go
through _Jordan_. The great High Priest stands ready to guide you, and
will land you safe in _Canaan_. _I præ, sequar._――Yet a little while,
and my turn will come. In heaven we shall part no more. Till then,
my dear dying friend, farewel! O that I may hear that you go off in
triumph. But whether this be vouchsafed or not, I know you will die in
peace. To the GOD of peace and love do I most earnestly commend you.
Let this be your joyful language,

              _A guilty, weak and helpless worm,_
                _Into thy arms I fly:_
              _Be thou my strength and righteousness,_
                _My JESUS and my all_.

I send affectionate respects to both your sisters, and to Mr. _B――――_.
I pray that the LORD JESUS may love them as he loved _Lazarus_, _Mary_,
and their sister _Martha_, and I entreat you to accept this as a token
of unfeigned christian love, from, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLVIII.


                            _To Mr. P――――._

                                             _London, Sept. 4, 1750._

_My dear Mr. P――――_,

I Received your kind letter yesterday, which was like the prophet’s
roll, full of lamentation, and mourning, and woe. But what shall we
say? It must needs be that offences come.――Wo to the inhabitants of
the earth, and of the sea, for the devil is come down in great wrath,
knowing he hath but a short time to reign; but let us look upwards.
Every plant that our heavenly father hath not planted, shall be rooted
up; only let him that standeth take heed lest he fall. You must salute
dear Mr. _R――――_ and the rest of the brethren in my name. As far as
I know, we are like-minded as to principles, and I shall be glad to
do all that I can to strengthen their hands, only let nothing be done
through strife and vain-glory. Blessed be GOD, my poor labours never
met with greater acceptance in _England_ and _Scotland_ than now, and
I would gladly fly to _Wales_, but perhaps my coming had better be
deferred to the cool of the day. Let us not fear. This storm will blow
over.――Truth is great, and though driven out of doors for a while, will
prevail at the last. Alas, what are we when a party spirit lays hold on
us! I suspect the principles that are productive of such practices.――O
that these things may lead us nearer to CHRIST, keep us closer to
his blessed word, and be sanctified to the moulding us into a nearer
conformity to his divine image. The meekness and lowliness of JESUS, I
want to be a large partaker of. You must pray for me, and let me know
how affairs stand. My tender love to all. I am, dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCLIX.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                         _Portsmouth, Sept. 8, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

TO day my wife sent me the melancholy news of the death of your
Ladyship’s eldest daughter, but withal wrote me that she died very
comfortably. Indeed when I left her, GOD’s spirit seemed to be working
so strongly upon her heart, that I thought she would soon go to heaven,
or shine as a glorious saint on earth. It hath pleased a sovereign GOD
to cut short his work in righteousness, and call her home. A trial this
indeed, for your Ladyship! but a trial, in which I hope your Ladyship
will have grace given to acquiesce. O that with _Aaron_ you may be
enabled to hold your peace, and with the bereaved _Shunamite_ to say,
“It is well.” And if the Redeemer should call your Ladyship to part
with another daughter (hard trial for flesh and blood) may you be
strengthened chearfully to give her up, and hear the LORD of all Lords
saying unto you, “Now know I that thou lovest me, since thou hast not
with-held two dear daughters from me.” Now is the time, honoured Madam,
to prove the strength of JESUS to be yours. Now is the time to be
strong in faith, and give glory to GOD. The Redeemer will be better to
you than seven daughters. What a comfort is it, honoured Madam, for you
to think that Miss _C――――_ gave such comfortable evidences of her dying
in the LORD. She is blessed indeed, and the language of her departed
soul is, “weep not for me.” Comfort yourself, honoured Madam, with this
thought, and say like _David_, “I shall go to her, but she will not
return to me.” May this trial be sanctified to your Ladyship’s whole
household, and may your surviving children learn to die betimes! I
could enlarge, but am afraid of being troublesome. On _Tuesday_, GOD
willing, I hope to be in _London_ for one day, and shall be impatient
to know how the all-wise GOD is pleased to dispose of your Ladyship’s
other daughter. In the mean while, my poor prayers shall be put
up night and day, that your Ladyship may have grace given you to
glorify CHRIST in this time of need. I commend your Ladyship to his
never-failing mercy, as being, honoured Madam,

         Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, sympathizing, obliged,
                 and ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCLX.


                            _To Mr. R――――._

                                            _London, Sept. 14, 1750._

_My very dear Mr. R――――_,

GLAD was I, yea very glad, to receive your kind letter about two
days ago. I send you this in return, with ten thousand thanks for all
favours conferred upon me, by you and yours. They are all numbered, and
not one of them shall be forgotten before the LORD of all Lords, whose
mercy endureth for ever. Surely, his goodness and mercy have followed
me all the days of my life, and blessed be his holy name, I shall ere
long dwell in his house for ever. At my return to town, I was received,
though utterly unworthy, with great joy, and our LORD has manifested
forth his glory in the great congregation. I have preached in Mr.
_W――――_’s chapel several times, and I trust a young lady of high
rank was truly awakened about a fortnight ago, and who is since gone
triumphantly to heaven. Mr. _W――――_ breakfasted and prayed with me this
morning, and Mr. _H――――y_ was so kind as to come up and be with me in
my house. He is a dear man, and I trust will yet be spared to write
much for the Redeemer’s glory. I have prevailed on him to sit for his
picture, and it will be published in a short time. Two dozen of my
pictures, as my friends so earnestly desired them, are sent directed
to you. Be pleased to let them be disposed of, as shall be judged most
proper. O that my heart might in some measure resemble the image of my
dear LORD! You and yours will not fail to pray, that it may be written
in lively characters, and that I may go on my way rejoicing. I never
forget you or any other of my dear _Scotch_ friends. Just now I have
good news from _Kendal_; a young woman, whom GOD was pleased to awaken
when I was there, went off lately (as my friend expresses it) “with
flying colours.” Grace! Grace! LORD, make me humble! LORD JESUS, make
me truly thankful! I am just now going for _Chatham_. Last LORD’s day
I was at _Portsmouth_. Next week, GOD willing, I go to _Gloucester_.
I hope good Lady _D――――_ and her beloved son and daughter, &c. are
prospering in soul and body. I send them my most dutiful respects, and
ten thousand thanks, and beg you, my very dear Sir, to accept the same
from,

            Yours most affectionately in our blessed LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCLXI.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                            _London, Sept. 17, 1750._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

THOUGH it is a cross to me to be detained so long from coming
to _Ashby_, yet I trust hitherto my steps have been guided by an
over-ruling providence for good. Yesterday afternoon I returned from
_Chatham_, where I think there is as promising a work begun as almost
in any part of _England_. Last night the Redeemer’s glory was seen
in the tabernacle, and your Ladyship’s letter revived my heart, and
gave me some fresh hopes for ungrateful _Ashby_. My heart’s desire and
prayer to the LORD of all Lords is, that your Ladyship may live to see
much of the travail of the Redeemer’s soul. I am glad Mr. _M――――_ is
ordained, and hope Mr. _B――――_ will be the next, soon. By Mr. _L――――_’s
letter to him, I find your Ladyship has acted in the affair like
yourself. Your Ladyship shall have a copy of it, and you will then
see how matters go. Mr. _B――――_ is much for embarking in CHRIST’s
cause, and if the _D――――_ would but help him at this juncture, he
might be a useful and happy man. Both he and Mr. _H――――_ have the most
grateful sense of your Ladyship’s great kindness. The latter I believe
intends to winter with me in _London_. If possible, I will prevail on
Mr. _H――――ly_, at my return, to come and pay him a visit. To-morrow
morning, GOD willing, I set out for _Gloucester_, and intend coming
to _Birmingham_, and so to your Ladyship’s. In my way I hope to write
to Lady _B――――_, and be as particular as circumstances will admit. I
am surprized at your Ladyship’s doing and going through so much. But
what cannot a believer do, when strengthened by the blessed JESUS? Your
Ladyship will be remembered most heartily before him this afternoon,
it being our letter-day. That you may long live to shine in his church
below, and after death be translated to shine with distinguished lustre
in the realms of light and love above, is the continual prayer of, ever,
ever-honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and most
                  cheerful servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXII.


                        _To Lady B―――― H――――._

                                        _Gloucester, Sept. 22, 1750._

_Madam_,

AS I know your Ladyship had a great esteem for the late honourable Miss
_H――――_, I cannot but think a short account of her behaviour, under her
last sickness, must not only alleviate the concern your Ladyship must
necessarily have for so intimate a friend, but also excite you to pray,
that your latter end may be like hers. I think it is now near three
weeks since good Lady _G――――_ desired me to visit her sick daughter.
She had been prayed for very earnestly the preceding day after the
sacrament, and likewise previous to my visit in Lady _H――――_’s room.
When I came to her bedside, she seemed glad to see me, but desired
I would speak and pray as softly as I could. I conversed with her a
little, and she dropped some strong things about the vanity of the
world, and the littleness of every thing out of CHRIST. I prayed as low
as I could, but in prayer (your Ladyship has been too well acquainted
with such things to call it _enthusiasm_) I felt a very uncommon energy
and power to wrestle with GOD in her behalf. She soon broke out into
such words as these, “what a wretch am I?” She seemed to speak out of
the abundance of her heart, from a feeling sense of her own vileness.
Her honoured Parent and attending servants were affected. After
prayer, she seemed as though she felt things unutterable, bemoaned her
ingratitude to GOD and CHRIST; and I believe would gladly have given
a detail of all her faults she could reckon. Her having had a form of
godliness, but never having felt the power, was what she most bewailed.
I left her; she continued in the same frame; and when Mrs. _S――――_
asked her whether she felt her heart to be as bad as she expressed
herself, she answered, “yes, and worse.” At her request, some time
after this, I gave her the holy communion; a communion indeed it was.
Never did I see a person receive it with seemingly greater contrition,
more earnest desire for pardon and reconciliation with GOD through
CHRIST, or stronger purposes of devoting her future life to his service.
Being weak, she was desired to keep lying on her bed. She replied,
“I can rise to take my physic; shall I not rise to pray?” When I was
repeating the Communion Office, she applied all to herself, and broke
out frequently aloud in her applying. When I said, the burden of them
is intolerable, she burst out――“yea very intolerable,” with abundance
of such like expressions. When she took the bread and wine, her concern
gave her utterance, and she spake like one that was ripening for heaven.
Those around her wept for joy.――My cold heart also was touched, and I
left her with a full persuasion, that she was either to be taken off
soon, or to be a blessing here below. I think she lived about a week
afterwards: she continued in the same frame as far as I hear, and I
trust is now gone, where she will sing the song of _Moses_ and of the
Lamb for ever. The thoughts of this, comforts good Lady _G――――_, and
the same consideration, I am persuaded, will have the same effect upon
your Ladyship. Only methinks I hear your Ladyship add, “No, I will
not stop here. By divine grace I will devote myself to JESUS CHRIST
now, and give him no rest, till I see the world in that light as dear
Miss _H――――_ did, and as I myself shall, when I come to die. I will
follow my honoured mother as she follows JESUS CHRIST, and count the
Redeemer’s reproach of more value than all the honours, riches and
pleasures of the world. I will fly to CHRIST by faith, and through
the help of my GOD, keep up not only the form, but also the power of
godliness in heart and life.” That the glorious _Emanuel_ may enable
your Ladyship to put all this into practice, is the earnest prayer of,
Madam,

         Your Ladyship’s most ready servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXIII.


                                          _Eversham, Sept. 28, 1750._

_Dear Miss B――――_,

I Thank you for your kind letter, and thank our heavenly Father for
blessing the seed sown to any of my hearers. Not unto me O LORD, not
unto me, but unto thy free unmerited mercy, be all the glory!

                _If thou excuse, then work thy will,_
                  _By so unfit an instrument;_
                _It will at once thy grace display,_
                  _And prove thy power omnipotent._

Hitherto our LORD continues to help me. Since my return from _Scotland_,
I have been brought very low; but as my day is, so is my strength.
At _London_, _Portsmouth_, _Chatham_, and lately in _Gloucestershire_
we have had many pleasant seasons. I am now going to _Birmingham_,
_Coventry_, &c. GOD only knows when I shall see my beloved _Scotland_
again. Gladly could I live and die with my dear friends there. It is
my comfort, that those who are friends to JESUS, shall live eternally
together hereafter. I know several of late that went off triumphantly.
O that we may be kept from being cumbered! O that nothing may draw us
from the feet of JESUS! There, and there alone is solid peace to be
found. Every thing is good that drives us thither. That this may be
always your abiding place, is the earnest prayer of, dear Miss _B――――_,

              Your affectionate friend, and ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXIV.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. Z――――._

                                               _Ashby, Oct. 9, 1750._

I Should have written to you long before now, but I waited for the
arrival of Mr. _Habersham_’s ship, in which I expected letters of
consequence. They are now come, and two of the chief I send enclosed in
this, and shall omit saying any thing further, till I have the pleasure
of seeing you, which I hope will be some time next week or the week
after. Immediately after I left you, I have reason to think that the
glorious Redeemer (O infinite condescension!) vouchsafed to make me
instrumental in the conversion of Lady _H――――_’s eldest daughter,
who I hope is gone to rest. I am now at her Ladyship’s house with four
other clergymen, who I believe love and preach CHRIST in sincerity:
but _Ashby_ people reject the kingdom of GOD against themselves. At
_Portsmouth_, _Chatham_, _Gloucestershire_, _Birmingham_, _Wednesbury_,
_Eversham_, _Nottingham_, &c. our infinite High-priest has given
us pleasant seasons. I am now waiting every day for my wife’s being
delivered of her present burden, and hope ere long to rejoice that a
child is born into the world. O that it may be born again and made an
heir of the Redeemer’s kingdom. This is all my desire. Honoured Sir,
you see how freely I open myself unto you. I count it a great privilege
that you allow me this liberty, and I earnestly pray our blessed LORD
to reward you ten thousand fold. He has been pleased frequently to
comfort and encourage my heart this circuit, and in the midst of all,
lets me know he is my GOD. O that he may be my glory! O that I may be
never left to dishonour him! Reverend Sir, for JESUS’s sake continue
to pray for me, who, with grateful acknowledgments for all favours, beg
leave to subscribe myself, honoured Sir,

       Your most obliged, affectionate, though unworthy younger
        brother, and fellow-labourer in the kingdom of CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCLXV.


                       _To the Countess D――――._

                                              _Ashby, Oct. 11, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

IT would give me concern, was I to return to _London_, though from ever
so short an excursion, without letting your Ladyship know that you are
always remembered by me at the throne of grace. Upon such a throne the
Redeemer sits, holding out his golden sceptre, and asking us, “What is
your petition? And what is your request?” My request for your Ladyship
is, that you may increase with all the increase of GOD. This I trust
your Ladyship is daily doing, and consequently increasing in inward
happiness, peace and joy. The riches of the divine life are indeed
unsearchable. May your Ladyship dig for them as for hid treasure, till
faith be turned into vision, and hope into the endless fruition of the
ever blessed GOD! That time will shortly come. I have been labouring
at _Birmingham_, in _Gloucestershire_, at _Nottingham_, &c. to awaken a
sleepy world to a sense of it, and I trust not without success. On last
_Thursday_ I came here, and next _Monday_, GOD willing, shall set out
for _London_. Good Lady _H――――_ goes on acting the part of a mother in
_Israel_, more and more. For a day or two she has had five clergymen
under her roof, which makes her Ladyship look like a _good Archbishop_
with his Chaplains around him. Her house is indeed a _Bethel_. To us
in the ministry, it looks like a college. We have the Sacrament every
morning, heavenly conversation all day, and preach at night. This is
to _live at Court_, indeed. Last night I had the pleasure of seeing a
little flock that seemed to be awakened by the grace of GOD; so that
even out of ungrateful _Ashby_, I trust there will be raised up many
children unto _Abraham_. Your Ladyship, and the other elect Ladies, are
never forgotten by us. I would write to good Lady _F――――_, but I hear
she is out of town. That the choicest of divine blessings, even the
sure mercies of _David_, may follow you both all the days of your lives,
is the hearty prayer of, honoured Madam,

       Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXVI.


                          _To Lady ♦H――――n._

                                              _Ashby, Oct. 11, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

IT is with great pleasure that I have heard of your Ladyship’s being so
supported under your late bereavement, and of the good impressions made
on surviving relations by it. Thus the Redeemer delights to magnify
his strength in his people’s weakness, and causes the death of one, to
be the life, as it were, the resurrection of another. O what amazing
mysteries will be unfolded, when each link in the golden chain of
Providence and Grace, shall be seen and scanned by beatified spirits in
the kingdom of heaven! There all will appear symmetry and harmony, and
even the most intricate and seemingly most contrary dispensations, will
be evidenced to be the result of infinite and consummate wisdom, power,
and love. Above all, there the believer will see the infinite depths
of that mystery of godliness, “GOD manifested in the flesh,” and join
with that blessed choir, who with a restless unweariedness are ever
singing the song of _Moses_ and the Lamb. There your Ladyship I believe
will see your departed daughter, not struggling with a burning fever,
but burning with love extatic, and with seraphic sweetness adoring that
Redeemer, who at the eleventh hour, even on a dying bed, snatched her
as a brand out of the fire. But what am I doing? I fear, making your
Ladyship’s wounds to bleed afresh.――But, honoured Madam, is it not
a pleasant bleeding, to think of bearing children for heaven! To see
those nearest and dearest parts of ourselves go before us thither――O
what a favour is this! May your Ladyship be always thus highly favoured:
may you live to see all your surviving children taught and born of GOD.
I must not enlarge. Neither have I room to acquaint your Ladyship, how
that mirror of piety, good Lady _H――――_, adorns the gospel of her LORD
in all things. I wrote some particulars of our situation to the good
Countess. I can now only add, that when I come to town, your Ladyship
may at any time command, honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

    ♦ “H――――m” replaced with “H――――n”




                           LETTER DCCCLXVII.


                            _To Mr. T――――._

                                              _Ashby, Oct. 13, 1750._

_My very dear Mr. T――――_,

YOUR kind letter did not reach me till about two days ago. I embrace
the first opportunity of answering it. If you write often, GOD willing,
you shall hear oftener from me. You are peculiarly dear to me, and
therefore I heartily wish you was thrust out into our LORD’s harvest.
_Vox populi_, much more _vox amicorum_, is frequently _vox Dei_. I say
to you, as a good old minister did to one whom you know, and who was
as unwilling to go into the vineyard, as you can be, “I believe if St.
_Paul_ was alive, he would ordain you.” You have a moderate share of
learning, an agreeable address, a good elocution, a little knowledge
of mankind, and of yourself, and above all an experimental acquaintance
with the LORD JESUS CHRIST, with a door of usefulness immediately
opening; and what would you more? I wish some latent pride may not
be at the bottom. Lose no more time, my dear man. The voice of CHRIST
to you now is, “Follow me, and I will make thee a fisher of men.” The
harvest is great, the labourers are few. Thousands are perishing for
lack of that knowledge, which you have already. The world wants more
heat than light. _Crescit eundo, crescit agendo_, is a young minister’s
motto. I think the Itinerancy abroad would suit you well. By travelling
before you take on you a settled charge, you will get a deeper insight
into the world and the church; you will insensibly acquire larger and
more sublime thoughts of GOD’s providence and grace, and consequently
be more fit to serve whatever flock the Holy Ghost shall hereafter
place you over. I believe that your honoured father loves CHRIST too
well, to stand out long against a rational scheme for the extensive
usefulness of his son. He is a dear man, whom I love in the bowels of
JESUS CHRIST. Pray remember me to him in the kindest manner, and tell
him I purpose writing to him as soon as possible. This leaves me at
_Ashby_, at good Lady _H――――n_’s, whose house is indeed a _Bethel_
to those who are willing to follow her, as she follows JESUS CHRIST.
One of high rank, I really believe, was converted lately on a dying
bed, and her death I trust hath proved the life of one or two more.
One of the _Kendal_ converts is gone off in flying colours, and our
blessed LORD has given us sweet seasons at _Portsmouth_, _Chatham_,
_Gloucestershire_, _Birmingham_, _Eversham_, _Wednesbury_, _Nottingham_,
&c. Next _Monday_, GOD willing, I go for _London_, in order to put
into winter quarters. The LORD prepare me for a fresh campaign! Do you
know any one fit for a Tutor at _Georgia_? I am glad that _New Jersey_
college succeeds. I had lately a letter from Governor _Belcher_, which
I suppose you have seen; it was sent to Mr. _N――――_. Colonel _W――――_
proposes that Mr. _P――――_ shall come over with one of the _Indians_;
I wish he may. I am sorry to hear that Mr. ―――― is likely to destroy
himself by hard study. I had rather he would kill himself with hard
working, and going about to do good. Mr. _G――――_ seems to me to have
chosen the better part. How is dear Mr. _R―――― W――――_? I hope he
is like a flame of fire. Pray salute him and all my dear, very dear
friends in the tenderest manner. I could live and die with them. In
heaven we shall live together. There we shall see our dear Mr. _L――――_.
I hope your little choir are every day learning more and more of the
new song, in order to join him in the realms above.――You have all my
hearty love and prayers. Accept the same yourself in a very particular
manner from, very dear Sir,

            Yours most affectionately in a precious CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCLXVIII.


                         _To Governor B――――._

                                              _Ashby, Oct. 13, 1750._

_Honoured Sir_,

I Had the favour of your Excellency’s letter, and took the liberty
of communicating it to good Lady _H――――n_, who shines in the church
of CHRIST on this side the water, as a star of the first magnitude.
Her Ladyship will be very glad to open a correspondence with your
Excellency; and seems to speak of _New-Jersey_ College with great
satisfaction. I rejoice to hear that it is in a prosperous situation.
If Mr. _P――――_ or Mr. _B――――_ can be prevailed on to come over, I am
persuaded liberal contributions will be raised both in _England_ and
_Scotland_. All was ready, if dear Mr. _A――――_ had not been taken off
by death; but even this our blessed LORD can and will over-rule for
good. I think it forebodes good for _America_, that such a spirit is
excited in so many provinces for promoting a learned and religious
education. GOD only knows how much my heart is on that side the water.
I should certainly have embarked about this time, did not my wife daily
expect an hour of travail. I can only say, “It is the LORD; let him do
what seemeth him good.” Blessed be his name, fresh doors for usefulness
are opened every week. We had a blessed scene this Summer in _Scotland_,
and ever since I have been ranging about, to see who will believe
the gospel report. O that I may die in the field! I am now at my good
Lady’s with three clergymen that love and preach JESUS CHRIST. Several
souls have been awakened here. One of high birth was lately converted
on her dying bed; and by that means I trust one or two more are put
upon securing the one thing needful. On _Monday_ I shall leave her
Ladyship, to go for _London_, which is to be my Winter quarters. I
shall long for _Spring_, that I may enter upon a fresh campaign. O that
my soul may begin to spring indeed! spring for Him who was stretched
upon the accursed tree to save my wretched soul. Blessed be his name,
that your Excellency has got such a sweet retreat in the decline of
life; where, free from noise and hurry, you and your consort may ripen
for heaven, and consequently be more and more fitted for your last
great change. That will now shortly come. Your Excellency is arrived to
a good old age. You have by faith seen the LORD CHRIST. You have been
instrumental in founding a christian college. Let death come when it
will, with good old _Simeon_, you may say, “LORD, now lettest thou thy
servant depart in peace,” for my soul hath experienced thy great
salvation! This I believe, honoured Sir, is all your desire. Our LORD
will grant it to you. O that when you are near his throne, you may have
a petition upon your heart for unworthy, ill-deserving, hell-deserving
me! Your Excellency hath laid me under many obligations; let me entreat
you by the mercies of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, to add to them by not
ceasing to pray for me, that as I have had much forgiven me, I may,
with _Magdalen_, love much; and being a brand plucked out of the
burning, I may, in GOD’s own time and way, be translated to dwell with
JESUS in his kingdom. As our LORD enables, the favour shall constantly
be returned in behalf of you and yours, by, honoured Sir,

          Your Excellency’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXIX.


                           _To Baron Z――――._

                                              _London, Nov. 9, 1750._

_Honoured Sir_,

THE love of JESUS CHRIST constrains me to send you a few lines. They
flow from a heart truly sympathizing with your beloved Baroness, under
your present trials. O that patience may have its perfect work in your
souls! O that with your tempted, afflicted, agonizing JESUS, you may
be enabled to say, “The cup, which our heavenly Father hath given us,
shall we not drink it?” I doubt not, but you find it sweetened with his
love:――“for he will not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able
to bear; but will with the temptation make a way for us to escape.”
The sacrificing our relations to his sovereign good will and pleasure,
is no small trial, especially when unconverted. But what says the
scripture? “Neither did his brethren believe on him.” Your LORD can
sympathize with you under your present circumstances;

              _He knows what this temptation means,_
              _For he has felt the same._

Look up, therefore, to him, honoured Sir, who has promised never to
leave nor forsake you. He hath helped you out of six, he will also
help you out of seven troubles. I write this out of the fulness of
my heart. My poor prayers are continually ascending to the throne of
grace in your behalf. I hope you will not be offended at my freedom
in writing. Love and gratitude are my only motives. Good Lady _H――――n_
will sympathize with you, when she hears how you are situated. I left
her some little time past abounding in the work of the LORD. I had a
pleasant excursion into the country, and my Winter quarters are made
very agreeable in town. What shall I render unto the LORD? Honoured Sir,
I beg a continued interest in your prayers, and those of your honoured
Baroness.――You know my name,――I am the chief of sinners, less than the
least of all saints, but for JESUS CHRIST’s sake,

                   Your sympathizing ready servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCLXX.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                         _Canterbury, Nov. 20, 1750._

_My dear Mr. S――――_,

BY that time yours reached _London_, I suppose my last will have
reached _Dublin_, and find you on the full stretch for him, who was
stretched upon the cross for you and me. As far as I can judge of the
circumstances you related to me, settling as you propose, will not
hinder, but rather further you in your present work. Only beware of
nestling. If you do, and GOD loves you (as I believe he does) you shall
have thorns enough put into your nest. O that I may be enabled, even
to the end, to evidence, that nothing but a pure disinterested love to
CHRIST and souls, caused me to begin, go on, and hold out, in pursuing
the present work of GOD! I have seen so many that once bid exceedingly
fair, and afterwards, _Demas_ like, preferred the world to CHRIST, that
I cannot be too jealous over myself, or others whom I profess to love.
This is my motive in writing to you, love, even love unfeigned; love
for CHRIST’s sake, and the good of souls. O let no one take away your
crown. If you marry, let it be in the LORD, and for the LORD, and then
the LORD will give it his blessing. Only remember this, marry when
or whom you will, expect trouble in the flesh. But I spare you. Seven
years hence, if we should live and meet, we can talk better of these
things. In the mean while, let us go on leaning on our Beloved. He, and
He alone, can keep us unspotted from the world. Does the work prosper
among you? It increases here. At _Canterbury_ I find several souls are
awakened. GOD willing, I leave it to-morrow. You must pray for me, and
exhort all to continue their prayers also. I expect, one day or another,
to see some glorious days in _Ireland_. I am called away.――For the
present, adieu.

            Yours most affectionately in our blessed LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXXI.


                            _To Mr. T――――._

                                             _London, Nov. 30, 1750._

_My dear Mr. T――――_,

AS I love you in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST, and look upon you as an
aged friend of the blessed Bridegroom, and my friend for his great
name’s sake, I cannot help dropping you a few lines. They are lines of
gratitude; lines of thanks for all favours conferred upon me when in
_Scotland_. They leave me pleasantly sojourning in my Winter quarters,
and longing for the Spring that I may enter upon a fresh campaign. Now
and then I make little excursions, and can inform you, that there is a
sweet work begun and carrying on at _Canterbury_ and _Chatham_. I long
to hear that your son _John_ has put his hand to the gospel plough,
and am not without hopes that his lot will be to itinerate, at least
for a while. He seems to be qualified for such an employ. I shall be
glad to see him on the other side of the water. Had I the management
of a thousand youths, if circumstances would allow, they should travel
for one year at least, before they took upon them a settled charge.
Methinks I hear you say, “What! will you take my _Benjamin_ away?” This
was old _Jacob_’s infirmity. You love CHRIST too well to refuse giving
up the young lad, if it should appear in providence that the LORD hath
need of him either at home or abroad. I pray GOD to direct and bless
you both, and to establish his covenant with you and your seed for ever.
You are now on the decline of life. I have been just reading about the
year of jubilee. How joyful were the prisoners when they heard of the
approach of that wish’d-for day! How much more joyful may those be, who
having an interest in JESUS CHRIST, are waiting for the last trump, to
proclaim our eternal jubilee in heaven! This, my dear friend, is your
happy lot. Rejoice, and again I say, rejoice. The day of our complete
redemption draweth nigh. Let us then lift up our heads, and let us
lift up our hearts to praise him, from whom alone cometh our salvation.
I could enlarge, but am called away. My hearty love to all enquiring
friends. I think to write to your son soon. We had a happy day
yesterday among the Great Ones. I am, my very dear Sir,

              Yours most affectionately in our dear LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXXII.


                          _To Doctor W――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 17, 1750._

_My dear Doctor_,

I Received your kind letter, and would have answered it much sooner,
had I not been prevented by sickness. For near a fortnight past, I
have been confined to my room; but through the divine blessing, am
now enabled to preached again. Praise the LORD, O my soul. My disorder
was a violent fever: JESUS hath rebuked it. I am raised up once more.
O may it be that I may minister unto him! For me to live is CHRIST. But
alas! how little do I live to his glory! Yesterday I entered upon my
seven-and-thirtieth year. I am ashamed to think I have lived so long,
and done so little, and yet every year, day, and hour of my life hath
been crowned with the divine goodness. O my dear friend, let this be
our motto, _Vivimus ut viviamus_. It is enough when we come to our last
moments, to have nothing to do, but to die. Blessed be GOD, that you
have courage given you to speak to the dying. A word spoken in such
a season how good is it? May the great physician take you under his
peculiar care, forgive you all your sins, and heal all your diseases!
I purpose writing to my friend _J―――― T――――_, and others, as I get
strength. At present, I must content myself with sending general, but
cordial salutations, and begging the continual interest of your prayers
in behalf of, my very dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCLXXIII.


                            _To Mr. T――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 21, 1750._

I Have been lately near the gates of death, which has hindered my
answering your kind letter as soon as I proposed. Accept a few, though
loving lines now. I hope they will find you entered upon your trials,
and longing to preach the gospel, which you have felt to be the power
of GOD to the salvation of your soul. Every line of your letter seemed
to have this call in it, “Rise, _T――――r_, rise,――the harvest is great;
the labourers are few: pray the LORD of the harvest to send thee,
and many more like-minded, into the harvest.” I cannot write much at
present. Inclosed you have a few extracts. That from Lady _H――――n_,
came last week when she was dangerously ill. May the LORD continue her
useful life! I am now entering upon my seven-and-thirtieth year. O that
I may begin to live to him, who hath lived and died for me! I shall be
glad to know your friend’s answer about _Georgia_. If the LORD raises
up a solid, heavenly-minded, learned young man for a tutor, I shall be
glad. Nothing, I believe, but sickness or death, will prevent my going
over next year. Methinks the winter is long; I want to take the field
again. Could you send me all Mr. _G――――_’s weekly papers. We prayed
heartily last _Monday_ for the awakened _Hollanders_. I have heard of
several lately awakened here. To the blessed and glorious JESUS be all
the praise. My dear friend, my heart leaps at the very mention of his
name. When I muse of him, the fire kindles. O that you and I may shew
forth his praise while we have a tongue! Pray remember me to all in
the kindest manner, and beg them not to forget unworthy me. Let not my
being so slow in answering your last, prevent your writing speedily to,
my dear Mr. _T――――_,

            Yours most affectionately in our dearest LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXXIV.


                           _To Lady S――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 25, 1750._

_Honoured Madam_,

I Had the favour of your Ladyship’s letter on _Saturday_ afternoon, and
immediately communicated what concerned him, to my ingenious and devout
friend Mr. _H――――_. With this, your Ladyship will receive a line from
him. I persuaded him, that your Ladyship would not take it ill. Poor Mr.
_B――――_ is much obliged to your Ladyship for speaking in his behalf. He
happened to be with me, when your Ladyship’s letter came. The Reception
that your Ladyship’s kind motion met with, convinces me more and more,
that “Be ye warmed, and be ye filled,” without giving any thing to be
warmed and filled with, is the farthest that most professors go. Words
are cheap, and cost nothing; and therefore many can say, “they pity,”
and that extremely too, when at the same time, their practice shews it
is only a verbal, and not a real compassion. I often told the poor man,
that his dependance was too strong; and that I was afraid least help
would not come from that quarter where he expected most. He sends ten
thousand thanks for what your Ladyship hath done already. Surely he
is worthy. He is a lover of CHRIST, and his outward circumstances very
pitiable indeed. Your Ladyship will not be offended at the freedom I
take. You love to help the distressed to the utmost of your power; and
your Ladyship shall find that good measure, pressed down and running
over, shall be returned into your bosom. That your Ladyship may
experience the truth of this, in respect to temporals and spirituals,
more and more every day, is the earnest prayer of, honoured Madam,

       Your Ladyship’s most obliged, dutiful, and ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXXV.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                              _London, Jan. 4, 1751._

_My dear Mr. S――――_,

IMMEDIATELY upon the receipt of your last from _Limerick_, I wrote you
an answer, directed for you at _Limerick_ post-office, as you desired.
As you are going that way, ere this reaches you, I hope you will have
received it. I pray the LORD of all lords to give you such grace, that
all may see, that the doctrines of the gospel are indeed productive
of righteousness, and true holiness in heart, lip, and life. Mind
this, and then fear not. Continue as you are, until you are absolutely
rejected. I want not to proselyte persons to myself, but to the
glorious _Emmanuel_, my LORD and Master JESUS CHRIST. Perhaps He
may send me to _Ireland_; though some weeks ago I hoped that he was
about to take me to heaven. I kept my room near a fortnight, and
still continue very weak. This obliges me to be brief. My wife is now
expecting an hour of travail. Some time this month I trust she will
be delivered. She desires to be remembered to you. GOD willing, Mr.
_Z――――_ shall hear from me. I do not yet hear who is to be the person.
Unless you have thoughts of going abroad, I see no objection against
your altering your condition. May the LORD direct and bless you and all
in that important step! It is a change for life. We have had blessed
seasons here; but methinks the Winter is very long. O that I was
entering upon a Spring campaign! It is a new year. My dear Mr. _S――――_,
why should we not begin to begin to live to that JESUS, who has done
and suffered so much for us! I trust this is the language of your heart,

              _A life that all things casts behind,_
              _Springs forth obedient at thy call;_
              _A heart, that no desire can move,_
              _But still t’adore, believe, and love,_
              _Give me, my LORD, my life, my all!_

I hear you say, _Amen, Amen. Hallelujah!_ I must have done. Bodily
strength fails me. My love to all that love CHRIST JESUS. Brethren,
pray for us, is the earnest request of, my dear Mr. _S――――_,

            Yours most affectionately in our dearest LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

                            _To Mr. L――――._

                                             _London, Jan. 13, 1751._

_Dear Mr. L――――_,

BEFORE I had the pleasure of your letter, I had heard some particulars
of the late commotion at _Canterbury_. Ere now I hope you have been
directed to the choice of such means, as may, under GOD, open the door
wider than ever for preaching the everlasting gospel in your parts.
Satan has done at _Canterbury_ as he always does elsewhere; I mean,
he has overshot his mark. Such proceedings are too violent to hold
long. Exhort, therefore, my dear Sir, your fellow-soldiers, to quit
themselves like men, and be strong. Put ye on the whole armour of GOD;
and always remember, that through much tribulation we must enter into
glory. Now is the time for you to prove the strength of JESUS to be
yours. Your way to fight, is upon your knees. That weapon _all-prayer_
will do wonders. The devil has lost some servants, and he is afraid of
losing more. Therefore he rallies his forces as _Pharaoh_ harnessed his
chariots, and wants to bring you back to _Egypt_. Your business is to
go on. Though _Pharaoh_ is behind, and a red-sea before you,――ere long
you shall pass through the one, and see the other totally destroyed.
In patience possess ye your souls. GOD is able to bring the counsel of
every _Achitophel_ to nought. You know in whom you have believed. He
never did, he never will, he never can fail those that put their trust
in him. Think of those farewel words, which he spake in the days of his
flesh to his dear disciples, “Let not your hearts be troubled; in the
world ye shall have tribulation:――But I have overcome the world.” That
is enough to raise every drooping heart. He hath overcome for us; he
will overcome in us, and ere long call us to reign with him for ever
in glory. O blessed hope! Whilst I am musing on it, the fire kindles.
Brethren, my heart is enlarged towards you. The LORD strengthen you,
and give you to pray for

            Your affectionate friend, brother, and servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                                             _London, Jan. 15, 1751._

_Dear Sir_,

YOUR letter came safe to hand. I pray GOD enable me to answer it
agreeable to his will. Your call to enter into the ministry, seems to
be pretty clear, and if your health would permit you to be a tutor,
and courage be given you to act like a good soldier of JESUS CHRIST,
you might do unspeakable good in residing at college. If a person’s
health will not admit of such a residence, I think by the laws of GOD
and man, his absence may be dispensed with. Originally, _Fellows_ were
appointed to reside; but there is no general rule without an exception.
Particular circumstances can only determine particular cases. Mr.
_W――――_ I know hath been dispensed with many years:――and though I
cannot say I have approved of this part of his conduct, yet as he is
called elsewhere, and applies the college income to good purposes,
I suppose he thinks he acts an honest and christian part. As for
the difficulties you seem to place before you, I can only say, “_Nil
desperandum Christo duce._” Every new scene brings its new temptations;
but faith in the Son of GOD, will make us more than conquerors over
all. His love shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is the best
director and support in all circumstances whatsoever. For want of an
establishment in this, and through the prevalency of an hypocondraical
disorder, you seem to have particular scruples about particular things.
It is what all persons, entering on the divine life, are more or less
exposed to. “Meditation, prayer, reading, and temptation, (says holy
_Luther_) make a minister.” Your levity of spirit, and fickleness of
temper, are your greatest diseases. These are to be watched and prayed
against, and by divine grace will be overcome. Look up, therefore, dear
Sir, to the blessed JESUS. Out of weakness he can and will make you to
become strong, and turn your lightness of spirit into solid joy. Till
then, be content rather to appear stupid, than by giving way to the
luxuriancy of unsanctified wit, bring guilt upon your soul. Thus, dear
Sir, I have endeavoured to answer your letter; though I must confess,
as you are so near, I had rather converse with you personally. You
may use freedom with me. I rejoice that the glorious JESUS hath in any
degree blessed my poor administrations to you. I need not, therefore,
remind you to give him all the glory, and entreat you to pray for me,
who am the very chief of sinners, and less than the least of all saints,
but for CHRIST’s sake, dear Sir,

                       Your very ready servant,
                                                              _G. W._

                                             _London, Jan. 18, 1751._

_My very dear Friend_,

YOUR kind letter I received this morning. The love I owe you for
CHRIST’s sake, constrains me to send you an immediate answer. From
the same motive I just now wrote to Mr. _B――――_. Poor man! This is a
home-stroke indeed! I hope he and his yoke-fellow will now take a large
step to heaven. May GOD prepare us, my dear friend, for the finishing
trials! We must all have them in our turns. But wherefore should we
fear? Out of very faithfulness, our heavenly Father causes us to be
troubled. Of his infinite mercy he hath lately been pleased to visit me
with a threatening illness. I was just casting anchor;――but it seems I
must put out to sea again. O that it may be to direct others to the way
that leads to the haven of eternal rest! Who knows but I may sound the
gospel once more in _Scotland_? I have some thoughts of coming for a
little while, before I embark for _America_. You will desire all the
societies to pray, that the LORD would order my goings in his way. I
rejoice that they hold on their way. May they hold on and hold out to
the end! My constant prayer for them is, that they may increase with
all the increase of GOD. Many in town have been awakened this Winter. O
that I was humble! When shall that once be? O that I was thankful! Fain
would I burn with love and gratitude like a seraph.

              _With arms of love, and wings of faith,_
              _I’d fly and take the prize._

Well! Let faith and patience hold out a little longer, and all will be
well. He is faithful, who hath promised, who also will do it. Believers
should look more to JESUS. It is the only way to keep their hands from
hanging down, and to strengthen their feeble knees. Exhort all to this:
and pray salute every enquiring friend, every member of the societies,
in the most endearing manner; for indeed I love my _Scotch_ friends in
the bowels of JESUS CHRIST. Whilst I am writing to and thinking of them,
tears, but tears of love, are ready to gush from mine eyes. O that I
may meet them all in the kingdom of our Father! O that their lamps may
be always trimmed, and their loins girt! Behold JESUS comes quickly,
and his reward is with him: let us not leave him. Let us not flag in
the latter stages of our road. O our bleeding, agonizing, dying JESUS,
how have we pierced thee! At least how have I! O that we may look and
love, look and mourn, even as one that mourneth for a first-born or
an only son. Dear Mr. _B――――_ can now comment on this text. May the
LORD comfort his heart, and be better to him than seven sons! I can no
more. Affections of various kinds quite overflow. I long to begin to do
something for JESUS. A sense of my vileness and unfruitfulness, quite
breaks my heart. Surely I shall sing, free grace in heaven.――I write
this to you as a friend. The LORD be with you, and reward you and
all, for their sympathy with me and mine. Fail not to pray for me; and
believe me to be, my very dear Mr. _B――――_,

                      Yours in the best of bonds,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXXIX.


                            _To Dr. W――――._

                                        _Ashby-Place, Jan. 29, 1751._

_My very dear Sir_,

IT is high time to answer your kind letter. I am doing it at _Ashby_,
whither I rid post, not knowing whether I should see good Lady _H――――n_
alive. Blessed be GOD, she is somewhat better, and I trust will not
yet die, but live and abound more and more in the work of the LORD.
Entreat all our friends to pray for her. Indeed she is worthy. Her
sister-in-law, Lady _Frances H――――_, lies dead in the house. She was a
retired christian, lived silently, and died suddenly without a groan.
May my exit be like hers! Whether right or not, I cannot help wishing
that I may go off in the same manner. To me it is worse than death,
to live to be nursed, and see friends weeping about one. Sudden death,
is sudden glory. Methinks it is falling a sleep indeed, or rather
a translation. But all this must be left to our heavenly Father. He
knows what is best for us and others. Let it be our care to have all
things ready. Let the house of our hearts, and our temporal affairs be
put in order immediately, that we may have nothing to do but to obey
the summons, though it should be at evening, cock-crowing, or in the
morning. Physicians that are always attending on the dying, one would
imagine should in a peculiar manner learn to die daily. May this be
your daily employ! I believe it is; though, like me, you must complain
that the old man dies hard. Well, has he got his deadly blow? Die then
he shall, even that death to which he put our LORD. O that the language
of our hearts may always be, “Crucify, crucify him.” This is painful.
But the Redeemer can help us to bear it.

          _Thou wilt give strength, thou wilt give power;_
            _Thou wilt in time set free;_
          _This great deliverance let us hope,_
            _Not for ourselves, but thee!_

I write this out of the fulness of my heart. You will receive it as
such, and remember me in the best manner to all friends. We have had
good times. All glory be to JESUS through all eternity!

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXXX.


                        _To Lady M―――― H――――._

                                              _Ashby, Jan. 30, 1751._

_Honoured Madam_,

LAST _Monday_ evening, through the goodness of an ever-blessed Redeemer,
I got safe to _Ashby_, where I found good Lady _H――――n_ very sick,
though I trust not unto death. All advise her Ladyship to take a
journey to _Bristol_, for the benefit of the waters, which her Ladyship
seems determined to do. The death of Lady _Frances_, has not affected
her Ladyship so as to hurt her. She rejoices at the thoughts of her
sister’s being so quickly translated out of this house of bondage, into
the glorious liberty of the sons of GOD. Her death was a translation
indeed. Her Ladyship died without a groan. She seemed as it were to
smile at death; and may be said, I trust, truly “to fall asleep in
JESUS.” Ere long, she and all that sleep in JESUS, shall come with him.
I hope it hath been a purging time in this family. Almost all have been
sick in their turns. Lady _Selina_ has had a fever, but is better. Lady
_Betty_ is more affected than ever I saw her. A letter now from one of
the young ladies, I hope would do service. Lady _Ann_ bears up pretty
well, but Miss _W――――r_ is inconsolable. It is a house of mourning;
that is better than a house of feasting. The corpse is to be interred
on _Friday_ evening. May all that follow it, look and learn! I mean,
learn to live, and learn to die. This is a lesson which you and yours,
honoured Madam, I trust are learning every day. We had need be careful
to get our lesson perfect, since we know not when the Son of Man
will come, whether at evening,――cock-crowing,――or in the morning. To
be ready at that hour, is all in all. Good Lady _H――――n_ sends her
sincerest compliments. If any thing extraordinary happens before my
return, your Ladyship shall hear again from, honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCLXXXI.


                          _To Doctor S――――._

                                               _Ashby, Feb. 4, 1751._

_My dear Doctor_,

YOUR letter distresses me. GOD hasten the time when you shall sing
chearfully,

              _Be gone, vain world, my heart resign,_
              _For I must be no longer thine;_
              _A nobler, a diviner guest,_
              _Has got possession of my breast._

Why will you not shake off your chains? Why will you be stricken any
more? You must come back, or be undone for ever. What have you gained
by running from your father’s house? His servants have bread enough,
whilst you are perishing with hunger. Say, say, I pray you, without
delay, “I will arise and go to my Father.” His love keeps you uneasy;
his love hedges up your way; his love follows and pursues you with
this mighty famine. The language of all is, “Give me thy heart.” Be
content to become a fool for CHRIST’s sake. Your body as well as soul,
will suffer even in this world, if you do not comply. You are half
dead already. Faith in CHRIST, and the love of GOD shed abroad in your
heart, can alone cure you. You know too much to be happy without it:
and O that dreadful sentence, “It had been better for them never to
have known ―――― &c.” For CHRIST’s sake, remember _Lot_’s wife. You are
almost become a pillar of salt already. Out of anguish I write this.
May CHRIST’s love so constrain you, that you may never rest till you
find solid rest in him! Good Lady _H――――n_ is gone to take the air.
Your message shall be delivered. She is but poorly; and my wife writes
me word, that she is exceeding bad. This must hasten my remove from
hence. I insist upon Mr. _H――――ly_’s coming directly to _Ashby_, if
he has any regard for good Lady _H――――n_. She ought always to have a
christian friend with her. That you may have a feeling possession of
CHRIST in your heart, is the hearty prayer of, my dear Sir,

        Yours, &c. in great haste, but greater concern for you,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCLXXXII.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                              _London, Feb. 8, 1751._

_Dear Sir_,

YESTERDAY I saw your letter to Mr. _V――――_, which made me to think
a line would not altogether be unacceptable to you. And what shall
I say? Your case is affecting. O that your present confinement may
be sanctified to the setting of your imprisoned soul at liberty, and
bringing you home (after having so long fed on husks with swine) to
feed upon the fatted calf! You know the father’s behaviour to the
returning prodigal. He saw him when he was yet a great way off.――He ran
towards him,――filthy as he was, he fell upon his neck, and kissed him.
Thus, if you resolve with the prodigal, to arise and go to your Father,
will the ever-blessed GOD deal with you. He will embrace you in the
arms of his love; he will also cloathe you with the righteousness of
his dear Son, and cause joy to be in heaven even over you, on repenting
and returning to him. Is not this enough to encourage you to lay hold
on his golden sceptre? to resolve, in divine strength, to mortify
and bid adieu to all those sins, by which you have dishonoured your
glorious Maker? You see, Sir, what wages Satan gives; _death_ even in
this world, and alas! _eternal death_ in the world to come. GOD keep
you from this second death, and then temporal shame will be but little.
The way you know; JESUS is the way, the truth, and the life. He is
mighty, and willing to save to the uttermost all that come to the
Father in and through him. Come then, dear Sir, and throw yourself at
the feet of his mercy. He will not only pardon, but abundantly pardon
you. In JESUS CHRIST there is a fountain opened for sin and for all
uncleanness. “Wash ye, make ye clean,” is the call of GOD to all,
and now the particular call of GOD to you. May the Spirit of the
ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS, bring it home to your soul, and make it
effectual to your thorough conversion! Let this be your sole care. For
this and this only is the one thing needful. As for seeing Mrs. ――――,
if I was to advise (as it hath been hitherto deferred) I would have
you both decline it a little longer. Wait and see the issue of your
trial; she can do you no good, and by coming may do herself harm. But
this is a tender point. May Providence point out what is best! If we
acknowledge the LORD, we have a promise, “that he will direct us in all
our ways.” I commend you to his never-failing mercy, and beg you to
accept this from, dear Sir,

        Your sympathizing friend and servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCLXXXIII.

                                             _London, Feb. 26, 1751._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship’s kind letter, which came to hand yesterday, was an
unexpected as well as undeserved favour, and for which I return your
Ladyship ten thousand thanks. Surely the LORD of all lords will at
length answer the prayers of his people, and raise you up to the joy
of many souls. It would rejoice your Ladyship much to see what has been
doing here. I have not known a more considerable awakening for a long
time. The LORD comes down as in the days of old, and the shout of a
king is amongst us. Praise the LORD, O my soul! The inclosed, which
came from abroad, I believe will give your Ladyship satisfaction. I
think it is an earnest of good things to come. To-morrow I purpose
to leave _London_; but whether the rain and wind will permit me is
uncertain. I am at present quite feverish, by my late hurry and fatigue;
but GOD is my portion and my confidence for ever. Underneath your
Ladyship are his everlasting arms; you cannot sink with such a prop.
Your Ladyship must be made conqueror, yea more than conqueror, through
his love. That, is engaged to bring you through whatever sufferings
may be yet before you. He is faithful, who hath promised, “that we
shall not be tempted above what we are able to bear.” This is my
daily support. To explain GOD’s providence by the promise, and not his
promise by his providence, I find is the only way both to get and to
keep our comforts. Above all, I find that looking unto JESUS, is an
universal, never-failing antidote against every evil. This is what your
Ladyship knows by happy experience. May you know it more and more so
every day and hour! But I fear I weary your Ladyship, and therefore
hasten to subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCLXXXIV.


                            _To Mr. ――――._

                                             _London, March 1, 1751._

_Very dear Sir_,

YOUR generous conduct much affects me; it hath drawn me to the throne
of grace in your behalf. If any of my poor writings should be rendered
either entertaining or beneficial to you, I hope it will make me more
thankful to him, who is the father of lights, and from whom every good
and perfect gift cometh. Mr. _H――――_ writes me word, that his heart
is knit to you. I wish the colony affairs may not lie too hard upon
him. Whenever he dies, I believe he will die as it were a martyr for
the welfare of _Georgia_. He mentions Mr. _H――――_ for a magistrate
in his stead; if I might advise, nothing should be denied, that might
strengthen Mr. _H――――_’s hands. I know him to be a tried friend, and
one who has the good of that poor province exceedingly at heart. Young
_M――――_, he thinks, might be ordained for an itinerant preacher among
the negroes. A good beginning amongst them might be of vast consequence.
Mr. _Z――――_ hath this affair much at heart. I give you these hints
to be improved as you think proper. My views to serve _Georgia_ are
disinterested; so I believe are yours. Such intentions the great
Redeemer will own and bless one way or another. I wish I could have my
packet from _Westminster_, ♦before I leave town. I think you do right
to send the young gentleman to _B――――_. If he inquires for Mr. _J――――
S――――_ a merchant, he will be taken care of. _B――――_ is no good place
however for young men, for there young _B――――_ has been hurt. But alas,
if people’s hearts are not upright, change of place will avail but
little. This consideration induces me to send the inclosed. I commit it
to your care, and commend your better part to his mercy, who hath loved
and given himself for us. That you may experience all the unsearchable
riches of his superabundant grace, is the earnest prayer of, very dear
Sir,

         Your affectionate friend, and very obliged and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Sir_,

YOUR acknowledgment for my poor present, is more than it deserved.
If it is made of use to your precious soul, I have my desired end. My
heart’s desire and prayer to GOD is, that his goodness may lead you to
a thorough repentance, and that you may have no rest, till you truly
believe on JESUS CHRIST. Reformation is not renovation: and unless
the heart be totally and thoroughly changed, when the fear of hell and
other outward restraints are gone, good impressions will gradually wear
off, and the seeming convert return again to folly. The love of CHRIST
therefore constrains me, dear Sir, to exhort you to make thorough work
of it, and to give all diligence to make your calling and election sure.
Now indeed is the accepted time! Surely you may say, “Am I not a brand
plucked out of the burning?” Satan will not care that you should leave
him without some attacks. When you are abroad, old habits, and old
corruptions will strive to renew their ancient acquaintance with you:
merry company will endeavour to redebauch you, and your grand adversary
the devil will labour to render all the amazing mercies you have
received, fruitless and abortive.――Be upon your guard. Distrust
yourself. Be instant in prayer. Look continually to JESUS, and then as
your day is, so shall your strength be. Be pleased to accept this in
love. If I may judge of your aspect and letter, you will. Glad shall I
be to find you a new creature in _Georgia_. My prayers shall follow you,
and I hope ere long we shall meet with our brother and all the redeemed
of the LORD in paradise. Be pleased to remember me to Mr. _R――――_; and
if you would mind me, as the chief of sinners and less than the least
of all saints, when you get access to the throne of grace, you would
oblige, dear Sir,

                  Your real friend for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                     _To the Reverend Mr. H――――._

                                           _Bristol, March 17, 1751._

_My very dear Friend_,

THIS comes with a summons from good Lady _H――――_, for you to appear in
_Bristol_, and abide for a month or two at my brother’s house. You must
not refuse. The GOD who has carried that elect Lady through such bad
roads from _Ashby_ hither, will take care of you, and I am persuaded
you will not repent your journey. Her Ladyship made the motion to me,
and intends writing herself. Blessed be GOD, she is much better, and
I trust will do well. She will have nobody to give her the Sacrament
unless you come. I hope this will find you at the tabernacle house, and
trust shall hear of your sister’s safe delivery. My tender and cordial
respects await her, your dear brother, and his whole houshold. I
ventured the other day to put out a guinea to interest for you. It was
to release an excellent christian, who by living very hard, and working
near twenty hours out of four-and-twenty, had brought himself very low.
He has a wife and four children, and was above two guineas in debt. I
gave one for myself and one for you. We shall have good interest for
our money in another world. O for a mind like his, who though he was
rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might
become rich! I have been recommending him this morning, and purpose
doing so again this evening. In _Gloucestershire_ the word hath been
gladly received, and here we have had pleasant gales. O my dear Sir,
follow me with your prayers. The LORD be with your spirit. I commend
you to his never-failing mercy, and am, my very dear friend,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._

                                           _Bristol, March 22, 1751._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

I Lately received your last kind letter, and am glad to find that you
are enabled to joy in tribulation, and to say, “Father, not my will,
but thine be done.” May the LORD increase your faith, and if you should
be called to give up your _Isaac_, your dear yoke-fellow, may you,
_Aaron_ like, hold your peace, and by an undissembled resignation
to the divine will, glorify your GOD! My wife has been in pitiable
circumstances for some time. The LORD only knows what will be the issue
of them. This is my comfort, “all things work together for good to
those that love GOD.” He is the father of mercies, and the GOD of all
consolation. He can bring light out of darkness, and cause the barren
wilderness to smile. This I trust will be verified in _Georgia_. Thanks
be to GOD, that the time for favouring that Colony seems to be come.
I think now is the season for us to exert our utmost for the good of
the poor _Ethiopians_. We are told, that even they are soon to stretch
out their hands unto GOD. And who knows but their being settled in
_Georgia_, may be over-ruled for this great end? As for the lawfulness
of keeping slaves, I have no doubt, since I hear of some that
were bought with _Abraham_’s money, and some that were born in his
house.――And I cannot help thinking, that some of those servants
mentioned by the Apostles in their epistles were or had been slaves.
It is plain, that the _Gibeonites_ were doomed to perpetual slavery,
though liberty is a sweet thing to such as are born free, yet to those
who never ♦knew the sweets of it, slavery perhaps may not be so irksome.
However this be, it is plain to a demonstration, that hot countries
cannot be cultivated without negroes. What a flourishing country might
_Georgia_ have been, had the use of them been permitted years ago? How
many white people have been destroyed for want of them, and how many
thousands of pounds spent to no purpose at all? Had Mr. _Henry_ been in
_America_, I believe he would have seen the lawfulness and necessity of
having negroes there. And though it is true, that they are brought in a
wrong way from their own country, and it is a trade not to be approved
of, yet as it will be carried on whether we will or not; I should think
myself highly favoured if I could purchase a good number of them, in
order to make their lives comfortable, and lay a foundation for
breeding up their posterity in the nurture and admonition of the LORD.
You know, dear Sir, that I had no hand in bringing them into _Georgia_;
though my judgment was for it, and so much money was yearly spent to no
purpose, and I was strongly importuned thereto, yet I would not have a
negro upon my plantation, till the use of them was publicly allowed in
the colony. Now this is done, dear Sir, let us reason no more about it,
but diligently improve the present opportunity for their instruction.
The trustees favour it, and we may never have a like prospect. It
rejoiced my soul, to hear that one of my poor negroes in _Carolina_
was made a brother in CHRIST. How know we but we may have many such
instances in _Georgia_ ere it be long? By mixing with your people, I
trust many of them will be brought to JESUS, and this consideration,
as to us, swallows up all temporal inconveniencies whatsoever. Thus,
my dear Sir, I have opened my mind to you on this head; if it satisfies
you, I shall be glad; though I suppose what holy Mr. _Z――――n_ has
already written, has been sufficient. His heart seems touched with
a sympathy for these poor creatures, and in the fall, GOD willing,
I intend seeing what can be done towards laying a foundation. LORD
prosper this work of our hands upon us, prosper thou, O GOD, our handy
work! I am now entering upon my spring campaign, and long for the time
to embark for _Georgia_. This I believe will shortly come. Blessed
be GOD, the work on this side increases daily. You will help me with
your prayers, and you will remember me in the kindest manner to your
collegue, your wife and dear congregation, and believe me to be,
reverend Sir,

           Your most unworthy, but affectionate brother and
              fellow-labourer in the kingdom of our LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

I Am persuaded you was surprized to find our elect Lady gone from
_Ashby_, and I was as much surprized to see her Ladyship at _Bristol_.
I hope her journey was of GOD. The waters agree with her wonderfully
already, and I trust she will be restored to perfect health. As dear Mr.
_H――――_ cannot be prevailed upon to come down, if it would any way suit
you to be with her Ladyship a month, it would much refresh her, and I
believe be very agreeable to you. Some pulpits would be open for you,
and who knows but you might catch some great fish in the gospel net?
But I need not enforce this, since her Ladyship hath written to you
herself. May the blessed Redeemer direct your going in his way! Put up
the same request for me. I have thoughts of going to _Wales_, _Ireland_
and _Scotland_. We have had good seasons in _Gloucestershire_, and at
_Bristol_, and the LORD enabled me to sow some gospel seed at _Taunton_
and _Wellington_ in my way hither. O that ever such a wretch as I
should be thus honoured!

                _If thou excuse, LORD, work thy will_
                _By so unfit an instrument;_
                _It will at once thy goodness shew,_
                _And prove thy power omnipotent._

For the present adieu. It is a grief to me that I cannot write oftener
and longer. I suppose the death of our prince has affected you. It has
given me a shock. “The LORD reigneth.” That is our comfort. That he
may reign more and more every day, and every hour, in our souls, is the
hearty prayer of, my very dear friend,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Sir_,

YOUR letter came safe to hand in due season, but I have been straitened
how to answer it. I would write as I preach; I mean I would speak
the truth as it is in JESUS, without endeavouring to blacken any
denomination whatsoever. I think _Gamaliel_’s advice is good at all
times, and in all ages, and our LORD’s promise will be fulfilled, “That
every plant that our heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted
up.” This makes me to bear and forbear with many who widely differ from
me both in principles and practice. This, as you observe, dear Sir, you
may know by my poor discourses, and I find as yet no reason to alter
my sentiments. I doubt not but there are many holy souls among the
_M――――s_; but their not preaching the law, either as a _Schoolmaster_
to shew us the need of CHRIST, or as a _rule of life_ after we have
closed with him, is what I can in no wise concur with. These seem
to be two grand mistakes, and which with their various unscriptural
expressions in their hymns, and several superstitious fopperies lately
intruded among them, make me to think, they are sadly departed from the
simplicity of the gospel. But to their own master they stand or fall.
_Exitus acta probat._ My prayer for myself and all GOD’s children is,
“LORD JESUS, rectify all that is wrong, and bless and prosper all that
is right!” I bless GOD, dear Sir, that you are appearing valiant for
the truth. You will find more and more by happy experience, that to
him that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. CHRIST never
sends a person on a warfare at his own charges. Do not despair of Mr.
_G――――_. As the love of GOD comes in, the fear of man goes out. By and
by I trust he will set his face on a flint. It is high time for some to
appear for JESUS. What pain did he endure? What shame did he suffer for
us? Strange! that we should be so unwilling to go without the camp, to
share with Him in his sacred reproach. Alas, what cowards are we! Dear
Sir, let us pray for each other, that we may be strong in the grace
which is in the CHRIST JESUS, and never fear what men and devils can
say, or do unto us. CHRIST is worth all, or he is worth nothing. I
thank you for your invitation in his great name. If providence should
bring me into the North, I hope to wait upon you. At present, I am
bound for _Wales_. I have good news from abroad, and I believe the work
is upon the advance at home. That you may be abundantly blessed, is the
earnest prayer of, dear Sir,

         Your affectionate though unworthy brother in CHRIST,
                                                              _G. W._

                                            _Exeter, April 11, 1751._

_My very dear Mr. H――――_,

I Was pleased last night to find by my wife’s letters, that your sister
was delivered, and more so, because my wife wrote as though you was
again under my roof. This I count a great honour, and such a privilege,
that I wish to have the favour conferred on me as long as I live.
These my hands (could they work, and was there occasion for it,) should
readily minister to your necessities. If my wife should come down to
_Bristol_, pray let not my dear Mr. _H――――_ move. If _Molly_ stays in
_London_, she will take care of you; if not, _Polly_ and Mr. _D――――n_
will gladly wait upon you. As I have been under some trying exercises
for this month past, I have often wished to see you. But my blessed
master hath given me access to himself, and he will make me more then
conqueror through his love. I find _Luther_’s words truly applicable to
myself, “He was never employed about any fresh work, but he was either
visited with a fit of sickness or some violent temptations.” Some good
I trust is to be done this Spring to many souls. This Western circuit
I believe hath been blessed already. I have preached about forty
times since I left _London_, and have been enabled several times to
ride forty miles in a day. I find that this sensibly refreshes me. I
wish you could say so too;――your _Biddeford_ friends would then see
you.――They hold on their way, and long to have a line from you. Old Mr.
_W――――_ is dead. I providentially met Mr. _T――――_ at his son’s house.
At _Plymouth_ we had sweet seasons, and on _Tuesday_ last I met with a
young clergyman who was awakened under my preaching seven years ago. He
hath been at _Cambridge_, and was ordained last Lent by the bishop of
_Exeter_. He is followed much, and I suppose will soon be reproached
for his master’s sake. What cannot JESUS do? I hope you find that he
gives you strength to proceed in your book. It is enquired much after.
The LORD be with you, and bless your pen, and your heart. I send my
hearty love to your brother and whole houshold, and am, very dear Mr.
_H――――_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

I Was uneasy that I had no opportunity of writing to your Ladyship a
longer letter than my last, at leaving _Wales_; but it could not be
avoided, and Mr. _P――――_ (to whom I delivered your Ladyship’s message)
promises to supply my deficiency. I am now at _Dublin_, where I arrived
the 24th instant. Mr. _L――――_ gladly received me into his house, and
I have been enabled to preach twice every day this week. Some seasons
have been very powerful indeed, and the congregations increase daily.
Last _Sunday_ I believe ten thousand heard with great attention. After
staying one LORD’s day more, I shall set out for a month’s circuit,
and then purpose going to _Scotland_. I find that providence has
wonderfully prepared my way, and over-ruled every thing for my greater
acceptance. O that I could be more humble and thankful! Surely here
are many converted souls, amongst whom are two or three students, and
several soldiers. May the LORD JESUS add to their number daily such
as shall be saved! I know not where this will find your Ladyship,
but where-ever you are, my heart’s desire and prayer to GOD is, that
you may have a thriving soul in a healthy body, and be rewarded ten
thousand fold for all favours conferred on, ever-honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

I Fully proposed to have written to you from _Wales_, but was prevented
by travelling and preaching. In about three weeks, I rode perhaps above
five hundred miles, and preached generally twice a day. Congregations
were as large as usual, and I trust an unusual power accompanied the
word. After being about five days on the water, I arrived here the
24th ult. At first the greatness and hurry of the place surprized me;
but thanks be to the LORD of the harvest, here as well as elsewhere
the fields are white ready unto harvest. I have now preached about
fourteen times, and find great freedom in dealing out the bread of life.
Congregations are large, and hear as for eternity. Perhaps last LORD’s
day upwards of ten thousand attended. It much resembled a _Moor-fields_
auditory. Next _Monday_, GOD willing, I leave _Dublin_, and set out
on a circuit to _Limerick_, _Cork_, _Athlone_, _Waterford_, &c. I now
lodge at a banker’s, who purposes to come to _London_ shortly. He is
a follower of CHRIST, and will be glad of your acquaintance. I purpose
giving him a letter. Have you heard nothing of Captain _Grant_? I
long to hear of his arrival, because I would fain go over with him
to _America_. Pray give me the first intelligence concerning him. A
long journey is before me, but I would be at home every where, and
yet never at home, till I come to heaven. There, the wicked will cease
from troubling; there, the weary will be at rest. There, before men and
angels will I declare how kind, yea exceeding kind, you and yours have
been to, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

                                            _Athlone, June 10, 1751._

THIS morning I had the wished-for favour and honour of your Ladyship’s
♦letter. O that it had acquainted me of your Ladyship’s better health!
But our LORD knows what is best. May patience have its perfect work,
and your Ladyship come out of the furnace like gold tried seven times
in the fire! Every day I can sympathise with your Ladyship. As the
weather grows warmer, my body grows weaker, and my vomitings follow
me continually. But all is little enough to keep me down, and prepare
me for the service in which I am engaged. My last from _Dublin_,
acquainted your Ladyship of my being owned of GOD there. By a letter
from Mr. _L――――_, I am informed, that _Dublin_ is in a ferment,
and that my hearers will be much more numerous at my return. Oh the
blessedness of leaving all for JESUS! For this week past, I have been
preaching twice almost every day in some country towns, and yesterday
I sounded the gospel trumpet here. Every where, there seems to be a
stirring among the dry bones, and the trembling lamps of GOD’s people
have been supplied with fresh oil. I find, through the many offences
that have lately been given, matters were brought to a low ebb. But
the cry now is, “Methodism is revived again.”――Thanks be to GOD, that I
have an opportunity of shewing my disinterestedness, and that I preach
not for a party of my own, but for the common interest of my blessed
master. May he keep me thus minded, and then I am sure all will go
well at last. Your Ladyship would smile, to see how the wise have
been catched in their own craftiness. O that this good news from
a far country may prove a cordial to your Ladyship’s soul! I pity
your solitary state. I pity the deadness of all around you; but your
Ladyship knows, whose brethren did not believe on him; it was even
that GOD-man, who spoke a parable for this end, that men ought always
to pray and not to faint. Happy trials, that drive us to our knees.
Ever-honoured Madam, I could enlarge, but must not. Your Ladyship
shall hear, GOD willing, how the glorious _Emmanuel_ deals with me in
_Ireland_. In the mean while, with the warmest sense of your Ladyship’s
unmerited favours, I subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,

        Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged and ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                                           _Limerick, June 14, 1751._

_Honoured Sir_,

MY last was written on board the _Crawford_, and sent immediately upon
my arrival at _Dublin_. Blessed be GOD, the word ran and was glorified
there. I preached above fourteen times, and every day great multitudes
attended. A friend, since my departure, writes me, that the city was
in a ferment. For about a week I have been preaching twice a day in
several country towns and villages. At _Athlone_ I preached four times,
and last night was gladly received here at _Limerick_. Every where
our LORD hath vouchsafed us his blessed presence. That supports me
under the heat of the weather, the weakness of my body, and the various
trials which exercise my mind. I am now earnestly asking counsel from
above. A wide door is open in _Dublin_; but after I have visited _Cork_,
I believe I must cut short my circuit, lest I should have a winter’s
voyage. I should have been heartily glad to have heard from or seen you,
but I trust, honoured Sir, you will have a heart given you to pray for
me, and then, one way or another, my way will be made plain before me.
Hitherto (thanks be to his free grace) my master supports and comforts
me. He administers seed to the sower, and as far as I can hear, blesses
it when sown. O that his mercies humbled me! O that I may never provoke
him to leave me, or lay me aside! Some dreadful offences have been
given in _Ireland_, but I trust all will work for good. My coming
was very opportune and providential. May I learn to follow the Lamb
blindfold, whithersoever he shall be pleased to lead me! Be pleased to
remember me at his throne, and as he enables, you shall hear, from time
to time, how he vouchsafes to deal with, honoured Sir,

         Your most obliged, affectionate younger brother, and
           unworthy fellow-labourer in our LORD’s vineyard,

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

STILL does the father of mercies, and the GOD of all consolation and
comfort, follow me with his blessing. Since my last from _Athlone_,
I have been at _Limerick_, where I preached seven times to large and
affected auditories. Much freedom of spirit did I enjoy there indeed.
――Yesterday I came hither (the seat of the late persecution) and thanks
be to GOD, have preached twice to a great body of people, with all
quietness. Both the Mayor and Sheriff have absolutely forbidden all
mobbing. Now have the people of GOD rest. O that they may improve it,
by walking in the comforts of the Holy Ghost! Next week, GOD willing,
I shall return to _Dublin_, and from thence purpose going through the
north of _Ireland_ to _Scotland_. So long a circuit in this kingdom
will be inconvenient for my voyage to _America_; but as divine
providence seems to point out the way,

              _Lord at thy bidding I will go,_
              _And gladly to poor sinners tell,_
              _That they a blessed CHRIST may know,_
              _That they his peace and joy may feel_.

I hope your Ladyship enjoys a large share of this, under all your
trials. They are great, but greater is he who hath promised to make
his strength perfect in our weakness. I commit your Ladyship to his
never-failing mercy, and beg the continuance of your fervent prayers
in behalf of, ever-honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, chearful
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                                             _Dublin, June 28, 1751._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

MY last from _Cork_, informed your Ladyship of my having preached
twice there to large and attentive auditories. From thence I went to
_Bandon_ and _Kinsale_, where a like blessing attended the word. At my
return to _Cork_, I preached five or six times more, and every time,
both the power of the word and numbers of hearers increased. I believe
on _Sunday_ evening there might be more than three thousand people.
Hundreds prayed for me, when I took my leave, and many of the papists
said, “if I would stay, they would leave their priests.” After
preaching twice in the way, I came here on _Wednesday_ evening, where
I have again published the ever-lasting gospel. Next _Monday_, GOD
willing, I set out for _Belfast_, and hope in about ten days to be
in _Scotland_. From thence, by GOD’s leave, your Ladyship shall hear
from me again: but what return shall I make for your Ladyship’s two
kind letters? I can only repeat my old tribute, my poor but I trust
unfeigned thanks. O for sincerity! O for a simple, disinterested heart.
I think that low politics are below the children of GOD, and if we
will be quiet, our LORD will speak for us. One to whom I had been
represented in black colours, writes thus from _Dublin_ to a preacher
in _Cork_,――“What blessed seasons have we had since Mr. _Whitefield_
came,――his coming hath been unspeakably blest to many. Thousands
constantly attended the word. His word is attended with power. I
never heard a man preach holiness of heart in a clearer manner.――He
powerfully preaches CHRIST for us and in us. I confess I had strange
ideas about him, but blessed be GOD, I have not now. GOD be praised
that ever I saw his face, &c.――――” Thus it hath been elsewhere. O
that I was humble! O that I was thankful! Not unto me, O LORD, not
unto me, but to thy free unmerited grace be all the glory?――May I
learn more and more to leave all to GOD, even a GOD in CHRIST! If his
cause be promoted, my end is answered. Let souls go where they please
to hear, and welcome. Thanks be to JESUS for giving your Ladyship a
disinterested catholic spirit. However afflicted, and in pain on earth,
you shall shine ere long in the kingdom of heaven. CHRIST hath prepared
a place for you, and is daily and hourly preparing your Ladyship for
the place. I am glad you are like to have some company. I beg that my
most hearty respects and acknowledgments may find acceptance with them
and good Lady _H――――_. I hope the waters will agree with the young
Ladies. Above all, I pray that they, and the whole circle of your
Ladyship’s relations and friends, may drink plentifully of that water,
whose streams refresh the city of GOD. I can now add no more, but to
subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXCVII.


                            _To Mr. T――――._

                                             _Belfast, July 4, 1751._

_Dear Mr. T――――_,

VERY providentially, your kind letter reached me this morning. As
I am detained by the importunity of the people, I must snatch a few
moments to answer it. Thanks be to the LORD of all Lords, if my poor
administrations have been any ways blessed, either to you or others.
“Not unto me, not unto me, but unto thy free and unmerited grace, O
LORD, be all the glory!” Preaching CHRIST, I find to be the best means
of winning sinners, and of building up saints. This done with a single
eye and disinterested heart, will make its way through all opposition,
and stand fast, when all other schemes built on a legal bottom and
supported by low politics, will fall to the ground. I wish you may have
grace given you to act aright in your present circumstances. Let all
bitterness and wrath and clamour be put away from you. Go on simply
preaching the everlasting gospel; and if rejected for that, and freely
discharged from your present connection, I shall do all in my power to
promote your usefulness. I suppose, you will hear from other hands what
hath been doing in _Dublin_. I hope the LORD of all Lords hath been
with us. Thousands flock in this place also, to hear the word preached.
I thought to have left _Belfast_ to-day, but have complied with the
people’s earnest requests, to continue in these parts till _Monday_.
O for a pilgrim heart with my pilgrim life! At present, I have no
thoughts of nestling. Fain would I be kept from flagging in the latter
stages of my road. I beg the continuance of your prayers. My prayer to
GOD for you and yours is, “that you may live together as heirs of the
grace of life, and walk in all the ordinances and commandments of the
LORD blameless.” You are entered upon a new scene, and will require
more grace to act your parts well, than at present you may be aware of:
But there is an all-sufficiency in CHRIST, who hath promised, that as
our day is, so our strength shall be. I commend you and yours, and all
the followers of CHRIST, to his never-failing mercy, and subscribe
myself, for his great name’s sake, dear Sir,

                 Your affectionate friend and servant,
                                                              _G. W._

                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                             _Belfast, July 7, 1751._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

LAST _Monday_ about noon I left _Dublin_, but with what concern
in respect to many poor weeping souls, cannot well be exprest. On
_Wednesday_ evening I came hither, and intended to embark immediately
for _Scotland_, but the people by their importunity prevailed on me
to stay. In about an hour’s time, thousands were gathered to hear the
word. I preached morning and evening, and since that have preached
at _Lisburn_, _Lurgun_, the _Maize_, and _Lambag_, towns and places
adjacent. So many attend, and the prospect of doing good is so
promising, that I am grieved I came to the north no sooner. The country
round about is like _Yorkshire_ in _England_, and quite different from
the most southern parts of _Ireland_. I am now waiting for a passage
to _Scotland_, which I hope to get either to-morrow or on _Tuesday_.
From thence your Ladyship shall hear from me again; in the mean while,
having preached to many thousands again this morning, I must content
myself with praying, that the best of blessings may descend on your
Ladyship, and subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                             servant, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCXCIX.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. Z――――._

                                            _Glasgow, July 12, 1751._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

AT length, a good and gracious GOD hath brought me out of _Ireland_,
where to the very last, the people heard the gospel gladly. In the
northern parts, multitudes attended, and was I not bound for _America_,
I would have stayed there much longer. People flock here as usual, and
I am enabled to preach twice every day. In about ten days I purpose
moving towards _London_ in order to embark. How my wife is, I cannot
tell, having not heard from her for some time; but I hope she will be
resigned. This, this is the cry of my soul,――

              _Bind, Father, hand and foot thy son,_
              _Nor leave thy work till all be done;_
              _O never let me, LORD, go free,_
              _Till all my heart’s resign’d to thee._
              _Then quickly to the altar lead,_
              _And suffer me no more to plead;_
              _No longer with the old |ADAM| bear,_
              _Lead on, dear LORD, consume him there._

Surely I shall be taken at my word. May JESUS support me in a trying
hour! I still beg a continued interest in your prayers,――and hoping
this will find you with a thriving soul in a healthy body, I subscribe
my self, honoured Sir,

           Your most obliged, affectionate, though unworthy
               younger brother, in the glorious Gospel,
                                                              _G. W._




                             LETTER DCCCC.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                            _Glasgow, July 12, 1751._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

I Think it long ere I send your Ladyship another letter.――My last was
from _Belfast_, where I preached twice on yesterday sevennight, and
immediately after took shipping and arrived the next evening at _Erwin_.
On _Wednesday_ morning, at the desire of the magistrates, I preached
to a great congregation, and ever since have been preaching twice every
day in this city. Thousands attend every morning and evening. They seem
never to be weary, and I am more followed than ever. Though I preached
near eighty times in _Ireland_, and GOD was pleased to bless his word,
yet _Scotland_ seems to be a new world to me. To see the people bring
so many bibles, turn to every passage, when I am expounding, and hang
as it were upon me to hear every word, is very encouraging. I feel
uncommon freedom of heart here, and talking with the winter, as well
as summer saints, feeds and delights my heart. My body is kept pretty
healthy, and my voice greatly strengthened, so that I think GOD is
preparing me for more work, or that some trial is at hand. This I
suppose will find your Ladyship yet in the furnace, but CHRIST is in
the midst of the bush, and in the fiery furnace too; he will quench the
violence of the flames, or cause the fire of his love to burn higher.
I could enlarge, but am straitened. Some ministers wait for me. Your
Ladyship would be delighted with our morning and evening auditories.
This day in the church we have had a blessed feast. To-morrow I take
my leave, and then for _Edinburgh_. There I expect to stay near a
fortnight. Glad shall I be to hear of your Ladyship’s welfare. You
have always my poor prayers, and my poor, but hearty thanks; being,
ever-honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                      servant, for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCCI.


                            _To Mr. M――――._

                                          _Edinburgh, July 29, 1751._

THROUGH the tender mercies of a never-failing Redeemer, I came here
safe yesterday noon. In the evening, and this morning, I preached the
everlasting gospel to thronged auditories, and met with a very kind
reception from my friends. LORD make me humble, LORD JESUS make me
truly thankful! As his interest seems to be concerned, and the King’s
business requires haste, I take this first opportunity of writing
about the _Virginia_ affair. In that province, there has been for some
years past, a great awakening, especially in _Hanover_ county, and
the ♦counties adjacent. As the ministers of the establishment did not
favour the work, and the first awakened persons put themselves under
the care of the _New-York_ synod, the poor people were from time to
time fined, and very much harrassed for not attending on the church
service:――And as the awakening was supposed to be begun by the reading
of my books, at the instigation of the council a proclamation was
issued out to prohibit itinerant preaching. However, before I left
_Virginia_, one Mr. _D――――_ (an excellent young man) was licensed, and
settled over a congregation. Since that, the awakening has increased,
so that Mr. _D――――_ writes, “that one congregation is multiplied to
seven.” He desires liberty to license more houses, and to preach
occasionally to all, as there is no minister but himself. This, though
allowed of in _England_, is denied in _Virginia_, which grieves the
people very much. The commissary is one of the council, and with
the rest of his brethren, I believe no friend to the Dissenters. The
late Lieutenant-Governor was like-minded.――I therefore think that Mr.
_D――――_ is raised up to succeed him, in order to befriend the church
of GOD, and the interest of CHRIST’s people. They desire no other
privileges than what dissenting protestants enjoy in our native country.
This I am persuaded your brother-in-law will be glad to secure to them.
I shall write to Mr. _D――――_ to wait upon his Honour immediately after
his arrival. I pray the GOD of the sea, and the GOD of the dry land,
to send him a safe and speedy passage, and make him a long and great
blessing to the inhabitants of _Virginia_. You may improve these hints
as you please. I beg the prayers both of yourself and dear yoke-fellow,
and assure you, that neither you nor yours are forgotten by, reverend
and dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_Honoured Sir_,

SINCE I wrote to you from _Glasgow_, a never-failing JESUS hath
vouchsafed to help me every day in preaching the everlasting gospel.
The congregations morning and evening amount to many thousands. People
flock more than ever, and are desirous of my longer stay, but I purpose
moving next week. I thank you, honoured Sir, for paying my wife a visit.
The inclosed letter I believe helped to make her sick; I have sent
it with this: be pleased to keep it to yourself, and let me have
the letter at my return. I little thought I was so much behind hand;
but GOD will keep me dependent. “Having nothing, yet possessing all
things,” must be my motto still. Honoured Sir, I hear that a ship is
going to _Georgia_ with more _Saltzburghers_. Are you concerned? Could
I go myself in her? Or could I send two or three little passengers?
Mr. _D――――_ shall call for an answer to these last questions. I
trust, honoured Sir, you are enabled to pray for me. I dread coming
to _London_, and think it would be best to part at a distance.――But,
Father, not my will, but thine be done! In heaven these trials will
be over. LORD, hasten thy coming! Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly! With
difficulty I get time to write this. But whether I write or not, you
and your collegue are never forgotten by, honoured Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

I Think it a long time, since I last wrote to your Ladyship. Continual
preaching twice a day, and paying and receiving visits, quite prevented
my putting pen to paper, as I would have done. However, thanks be to
GOD, matters go on in _Scotland_ better and better. The parting at
_Glasgow_ was very sorrowful indeed. Numbers set out from the country,
to hear the word, by three or four in the morning. Congregations
increase greatly. I now preach twice daily to many thousands. Many
of the best rank attend. My body is almost worn out, but in the LORD
have I righteousness and strength. I purposed to move as to-morrow, but
through the importunity of friends, have been prevailed upon to stay
till next _Monday_. O that it may be for a further blessing! I have
been to _Musselburgh_ to see Captain _G――――_ and his Lady.――They hold
on.――Mr. _W――――_ has been there, and intends setting up societies,
which I think imprudent. I was glad to hear that your Ladyship was
strong in body, and rejoicing in your soul. The joy of the LORD shall
be your strength. Letters from _Georgia_ inform me, that my family is
well. My eyes wait upon JESUS, from whom alone comes all my salvation.
He gives me hints, that he will provide. I sometimes wish your
Ladyship here. Such composed, thronged, continued, attentive, judicious
auditories perhaps were seldom seen. Your Ladyship is often remembered
by _Scotch_ friends, and never forgotten by, ever-honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                      servant, for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                                             _Kendal, Aug. 10, 1751._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

AS a good and gracious GOD hath vouchsafed to bring me thus far on
my way, I cannot help dropping your Ladyship a few lines. Preaching,
bodily weakness, and a variety of business, prevented my writing
again before I left _Edinburgh_. O _Edinburgh! Edinburgh!_ Surely thou
must never be forgotten by me! The longer I stayed, the more eagerly
both rich and poor attended on the word preached. Perhaps for near
twenty-eight days together in _Glasgow_ and _Edinburgh_, I preached to
near ten thousand souls every day. It would have melted your Ladyship’s
heart to have seen us part. Ninety-four pounds were collected for the
_Edinburgh_ orphans, and I hear of seven or eight students awakened
about ten years ago, that are likely to turn out excellent preachers.
Praise the LORD, O my soul.――Two of them came with me on the road,
and parted with broken hearts. Lord and Lady _L――――_ behaved very
respectfully. To the LORD of all Lords be all the glory! I am now on
my way to _London_, in order to embark for _America_. Thanks be to
GOD, the seed sown in _Kendal_ last year hath sprung up, and borne
fruit. One woman hath been with me, that seems to have received GOD’s
pardoning love. I leave it on _Monday_, and hope to be in town on
_Saturday_. Glad should I be, to hear of your Ladyship’s welfare. I
threw up much blood in _Edinburgh_, but riding recruits me. O that I
may begin to work for Him, who bled and died for me! To his most tender
mercies do I humbly recommend your Ladyship, and beg leave, from the
very bottom of my heart, to subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,

          Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged and chearful
                      servant, for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                                             _London, Aug. 29, 1751._

_My very dear Friend_,

AT length the struggle is over;――I have been dying daily for some
time, in taking leave of friends; and this afternoon I expect to go
on board the _Antelope_, Captain _Maclelan_, bound for _Georgia_, with
_Germans_.――I take several children with me.――Surely you will see the
_American_ land.――Mr. _E――――_, with your other friends, seem to concur
in thinking that a little travelling would do you service.――May the
LORD direct and bless you! Will you not write to me by _Cowan_? If
my dear friend Mr. _P――――_ could speak to that brewer that is so well
disposed, and he or any other would send in _Cowan_ a little good
beer, it would be acceptable in yonder wilderness.――Pray what says
Mr. _W――――_? If he should agree to go over, Mr. _W―――― R――――_ may be
applied to for cash.――I have several sweet little ones to put under
his care;――GOD’s will be done in this also! He reigneth, that is my
unspeakable consolation.――By next ship I believe will come a parcel
directed to Mr. _T――――_, with a folio book, and an hundred pictures of
_Aaron_ the _Indian_ preacher, from good Lady _H――――_, who is yet but
poorly.――Sixty may be disposed of among _Edinburgh_ friends, and forty
sent to Mr. _M――――_. The book you are to peruse, and then it must go
with the pictures to _Glasgow_.――Be pleased to apprize Mr. _T――――_ of
it, and desire him to send me a line by _Cowan_.――If possible, I will
answer Mr. _B――――_ before we leave the _Downs_. My tender love and
thanks await your dear father, family, and all friends. The LORD be
with you all, Amen and Amen! My horses sold for fourteen pounds. GOD
reward my benefactors! Perhaps Mr. _T――――_ and Dr. _Doddridge_ may go
off about the same time. _I præ sequar._ Mr. _H――――_ is better. And now,
my dear Sir, farewel! Be strong in the grace which is in CHRIST JESUS.
I commend you to his never-failing mercy, and, for his great name’s
sake, subscribe myself,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCCVI.


                     _To the Reverend Mr. G――――._

                              _On board the Antelope, Sept. 2, 1751._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

THOUGH I could not, through hurry of business, write to you on shore,
yet I would fain send you a few lines from on board. We are now near
the _Downs_, and, I trust, shall sail comfortably on.――The Captain
is civil; and the cabin passengers seem to be very agreeable company.
Parting seasons of late have been to me dying seasons.――Surely they
have broken my very heart: but it is for JESUS, and therefore all is
well. Remember, my dear, dear Sir, a floating pilgrim.――If possible,
send me a line.――Young Mr. _T――――r_ knows how to direct. I shall
rejoice to hear of your prosperity. Before my embarkation, I ordered
forty of _Aaron_’s pictures, and the folio book concerning the
_Moravians_, to be sent to Mr. _M――――_. They will be committed to the
care of Mr. _T――――_, in _Edinburgh_. And now, my dear Mr. _G――――_,
farewel, farewel! The LORD be with you and Mr. _M――――_, Mr. _N――――_, Mr.
_S――――_, and all my dear, very dear _Glasgow_ friends. I salute you all
much in the LORD, and beg the continuance of your most earnest prayers
in behalf of, very dear Sir,

            Yours most affectionately in our blessed JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCVII.


                               _On board the Antelope, Oct. 6, 1751._

_Dear Sir_,

I Have been just writing to one, to whom I know you will gladly convey
the inclosed. I must now send you a few lines: may the Redeemer attend
them with his blessing! At the great day, you shall know how often you
have been remembered by me at the throne of grace, this voyage. Blessed
be GOD, hitherto it has been a short and easy one! We are now within a
few hundred miles of shore; and He that hath hitherto helped, I trust
will help us even to the end. O that the blessings bestowed upon us,
may, through the thanksgiving of many, redound to thy glory, O GOD!
O that I could do something to promote this! As yet alas! alas! how
little have I done! Stir up then, my sluggish soul, and begin to exert
thyself for Him, who hath shed his dear and precious heart’s blood for
thee! O my dear Sir, is it not strange that we should forget this love?
Strange, that a little silver dust, should blind our eyes, and divert
us from beholding Him, who indeed is altogether lovely! A word to the
wise is enough. Our LORD hath dealt wonderously kind with each of us,
with us, and with ours. What shall we render unto him? My obligations
are much increased by the mercies of this voyage. Your kind present
was very useful. I pray the LORD of all lords to reward you ten
thousand-fold. You will remember me to your dear partner, and all
enquiring friends. That grace, mercy, and peace may be multiplied on
you all, is the earnest prayer of, dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCVIII.


                         _To Mr. J―――― T――――._

                               _Bethesda, in Georgia, Nov. 20, 1751._

_My dear Mr. T――――_,

ERE this can reach you, I suppose you will have heard of our safe
arrival in _Georgia_; for which, I trust, you and my other dear
friends will be thankful in our behalf. Blessed be GOD, I found the
Orphan-house in as good a situation as could be expected. The children
have much improved in their learning; and I hope a foundation is
now laid for a future useful seminary. I want to know what answer
Mr. _W――――_’s hath given. I expect letters by _C――――_, when I go to
_Charles-town_ next month. I was there about ten days ago, and had some
close talk with Mr. _L――――_, and several of Mr. _S――――_’s congregation,
concerning you. All seemed to be unanimous, in giving you a call.
I need only observe, that if GOD should direct your course to them,
you will find a generous, loving people, who will study to make your
labours profitable and delightful to you. I doubt not but in the
congregation there are many dear children of GOD. And as there will
be such an harmony between you and Mr. _L――――_, I hope you will be an
happy instrument of promoting peace between all parties, and adding
such to the church as shall be finally saved. Very near you, are
several pious ministers of other denominations, who will be glad to
keep up a christian correspondence with you, and strengthen your hands
in the work of the LORD. As far as I can judge of your disposition,
and all other concurring circumstances, your situation will be very
agreeable to others, and to yourself. However, a trial can do no hurt
to either side. A voyage to sea, and the seeing and conversing with
many of GOD’s people and ministers on this side the water, will make
it worth your while to leave your native country. Travelling improved,
will enlarge your ideas, and promote your future usefulness. May the
glorious _Emmanuel_ direct your goings in his way! If it should appear
to be the divine will that you should come over to _Charles-Town_,
I am persuaded, the good old man your father will chearfully let his
_Benjamin_ go; and he will find his blessed Master to be better to him
than seven sons. Pray salute him and all dear friends in the kindest
manner. I would write to many, but as yet have not time. Brethren, pray
for us. My very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCCIX.


                            _To Mr. K――――._

                                       _Charles-Town, Dec. 26, 1751._

_My dear Mr. K――――_,

MAY this find you getting out of your eclipse, and determining, through
the strength of CHRIST, that the earth shall never get in between
your soul and the Son of Righteousness any more! What mercies, signal
mercies hath the LORD JESUS conferred on you and me! What shall we
render unto the LORD? Shall we not give him our whole hearts? O let us
not follow afar off. Let his love constrain us to an holy, universal,
chearful obedience to all his commands. You have a wife that will
provoke you to love, and to good works. Make much of her; and present
her, and your mother, and all her children, with my most cordial
salutations. I do not forget them, or you, or dear Mr. _R――――_.
For CHRIST’s sake forget not unworthy me. I am now returning to the
Orphan-house, which I trust will be like the burning bush indeed. My
poor labours are accepted here; and in the Spring I purpose going to
the _Bermudas_. JESUS is very good to me. Help me to praise him; and
believe me to be, my dear Sir,

              Your affectionate friend for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCCX.


                        _To Mr. William L――――._

                                           _Bethesda, Jan. 25, 1752._

_Very dear Sir_,

MAN appoints, but GOD disappoints. Though we missed seeing each other
on earth, yet if JESUS CHRIST be our life, we shall meet never to part
again in the kingdom of Heaven. Your kind letter found me employed for
the fatherless, in this wilderness, and am almost ready to enter upon
my Spring campaign. The news from _Ireland_, does not at all surprize
me. Weak minds soon grow giddy with power; and then they become pests,
instead of helps to the church of GOD. You have done well, dear Sir,
not to desist from doing good, on account of some rubs you meet with
in the way. _Benefacere et male pati, vere christianum est._ Go on,
therefore, to lay up treasures in heaven; and let the world see, that
you have been with JESUS, by imitating him in going about doing good.
I intend, by his assistance, now to begin; for as yet alas! I have done
nothing. Continue to pray for me; and be pleased to assure our _Irish_
friends, that they are not forgotten by me. Who knows but I may see
them once more on this side eternity? As soon as possible, some of
them shall hear from me. Thanks be to GOD, the Orphan-house flourishes.
That the work of CHRIST may flourish amongst all persons of all
denominations, and that you and yours may be always abounding in the
work of the LORD, is the earnest prayer of, very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCCXI.


                       _To the Rev. Mr. H――――._

                                        _Charles-Town, Feb. 1, 1752._

_My very dear Friend_,

I Long to write to, and inform you, that I love you in the bowels of
JESUS CHRIST, and earnestly pray, that you may go on from strength
to strength, and increase with all the increase of GOD. This leaves
unworthy me, endeavouring to do something for Him on this side the
water. Glory be to his great name, he causes his work to prosper in
my worthless hands. The Orphan-house is in a flourishing way, and I
hope will yet become a useful seminary. My poor labours in this place
meet with acceptance; and after one more trip to _Georgia_, I purpose
setting out upon my Spring campaign. Follow me with your prayers; and
who knows but we may meet once more on this side heaven. Our dear Mr.
_H――――_ I find is to be detained longer from thence. I think he will
live to bury many stronger men. I wish _Lisbon_ may be blessed to Dr.
_D――――_; and O how do I wish that dear Dr. _S――――_ was fully employed
in preaching the everlasting gospel! Pray salute him tenderly in my
name, and beg him to renounce the world for CHRIST. I hope you both
write to, and see our good Lady _H――――n_ frequently. I was rejoiced
to hear, from my dear yoke-fellow, that her Ladyship was bravely: this
was joy indeed. May she long live to be a blessing! That is all in all.
O that I may begin to be in earnest! It is a new year; GOD quicken my
tardy pace, and help me to do much work in a little time! This is my
highest ambition. The LORD JESUS fill me with this ambition more and
more! For the present, adieu. Accept this as a token of your not being
forgotten by, reverend and very dear Sir,

 Yours most affectionately in our dear LORD JESUS,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXII.


                         _To Mr. S―――― C――――._

                                        _Charles-Town, Feb. 5, 1752._

AS I love you most tenderly in the bowels of JESUS CHRIST, you may
easily guess, what great pleasure both your kind letters gave me. They
came attended with a great blessing, and knit my heart, if possible,
nearer to you than ever. Part of the first, indeed, I mean that which
respected the Tabernacle-house, gave me uneasiness; but your last
removed it, and made me thankful to our common Redeemer, who in spite
of all opposition, I find will cause his word to run and be glorified.
Poor Mr. _W――――_ is striving against the stream; strong assertions will
not go for proofs, with those who are acquainted with the divine life,
and are sealed by the Holy Spirit even to the day of redemption. They
know, that their stock is now put into safe hands; that the covenant of
grace is not built upon the faithfulness of a poor fallible, changeable
creature, but upon the never-failing faithfulness of an unchangeable
GOD. This is the foundation whereon I build. “LORD JESUS, I believe,
help my unbelief! Having once loved me, thou wilt love me to the end;
thou wilt keep that safe, which I have committed unto thee: establish
thy people more and more in this glorious truth; and grant that it may
have this blessed effect upon us all, that we may love thee more, and
serve thee better!” All truths, unless productive of holiness and love,
are of no avail. They may float upon the surface of the understanding;
but this is to no purpose, unless they transform the heart. This, I
trust, the dear Tabernacle preachers and people will always have deeply
impressed upon their minds. Let us not dispute, but love. Truth is
great, and will prevail. I am quite willing that all our hearers shall
hear for themselves. The Spirit of CHRIST is a Spirit of liberty.
You remember what I have often told you about _Calvin_. He was turned
out of _Geneva_ for several years; but in less than twelve years
time they wished for their _Calvin_ again. But what is _Calvin_, or
what is _Luther_? Let us look above names and parties; let JESUS, the
ever-loving, the ever-lovely JESUS, be our all in all.――So that he be
preached, and his divine image stamped more and more upon people’s
souls, I care not who is uppermost. I know my place, (LORD JESUS enable
me to keep it!) even to be the servant of all. I want not to have a
people called after my name, and therefore I act as I do. The cause is
CHRIST’s, and he will take care of it. I rejoice that you go on so well
at the Tabernacle. May the shout of a king be always in the midst of
you, and the glory of GOD be your reward. I am apt to believe you will
pray me over. But future things belong to him, whose I am, and whom I
endeavour to serve. After one more trip to the Orphan-house, I purpose
going to the _Northward_, where I expect more letters by Captain
_Grant_. Thanks be to GOD, all is well at _Bethesda_. A most excellent
tract of land is granted to me very near the house, which in a few
years I hope will make a sufficient provision for it. Pray give my
tenderest and most hearty love to all your dear family, and all the
Tabernacle people, and all enquiring friends. Entreat them, I pray you,
to be mindful of a poor pilgrim, who night and day is never unmindful
of you or them. Doctor _Doddridge_ I find is gone; LORD JESUS prepare
me to follow after!――With real and great affection, I subscribe myself,
very dear _Jemmy_,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXIII.


                         _To Mr. J―――― H――――._

                                              _London, May 26, 1752._

_My very dear Friend_,

HEARING that Mr. _N――――_ is to go shortly from _Leith_, I cannot help
sending you a few lines. They leave me at _London_, where, through
the divine goodness, I am safely arrived, after a passage of near
five weeks on board the _Henry_. People have received me with great
affection; and I never saw the work of GOD go on in a more promising
way. Thousands and thousands hear the gospel gladly. LORD, what am I?
Not unto me, not unto me, but unto thy free grace and unmerited mercy
be all the glory! I wish I could send you good news about your minister.
But alas! I now almost despair of procuring one. I waited upon Dr.
_G――――_ immediately after my arrival;――he gave me no hopes. The person
that was fixed upon, declined it. Several of the large congregations
in _London_, besides many more in the country, are without pastors:
they are obliged to make use of our preachers. O that the LORD of the
harvest may thrust out more labourers into his harvest! Who can tell
but some ministers may be raised up at _Bethesda_? At _Midsummer_ the
King takes _Georgia_ into his own hands: blessed be GOD for sending
me over at such a juncture. He hath given me already good success
concerning Mr. _B――――_’s scheme. I am come to a determination, if I
can dispose of _Providence_ plantation, to carry all my strength to the
Orphan-house. May the LORD JESUS prosper more and more this work of our
hands upon us! Prosper thou, O GOD, this handy work! I trust he will. I
could enlarge, but have not time. You may expect to hear from me again
by Dr. _B――――_, whom I expect to see next week. Your _Rapin_ is bought,
and shall be sent with the other; I thank you for the loan of it, and
for all other favours. The GOD whom I serve, will richly reward both
you, and all my other dear _Charles-Town_ friends. My very dear Sir,
cease not to pray for

           Your most affectionate, obliged friend, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXIV.


                            _To Mr. T――――._

                                              _London, June 4, 1752._

_My dear Mr. T――――_,

I Doubt not of your being directed in your late choice. If we
acknowledge GOD in all our ways, he hath promised to direct our paths.
I pity poor _Carolina_. But what shall we say? JESUS may do what he
will with his own. I must look out for a tutor for my orphans. When our
LORD’s time is come, some one or other will be stirred up to care for
these sheep in yonder wilderness. Blessed be GOD, it begins to smile.
You will see by the inclosed, what a prospect I have of providing
for _Bethesda_’s future support. The letter was sent me by Mr. _J――――
B――――_, a worthy christian planter, who is lately come from _Carolina_
to settle in _Georgia_. He was awakened at the Orphan-house about
ten years ago. At _Midsummer_, _Georgia_ is to be taken into the
Government’s hands. It will then be put on the same footing with the
other provinces; and in all probability will be a flourishing province.
I am come in the very best time. O what a blessed thing is it to follow
JESUS blindfold! He hath enabled me once more to take the field. The
fields seem as white as ever; and I never saw the Tabernacle so well
attended. If GOD should so direct me, would the middle of _August_ not
be too late to come to _Edinburgh_? I cannot well come before. Does
Mr. _R――――_ go directly for _Charles-Town_? How will he be paid for
the Ossnaburghs he was so kind as to send over? I would fain send a few
letters by him. My hearty love to him and his. Ten thousand thanks to
you, for caring so friendly for my dear wife in my absence.――The LORD
JESUS will care for you and my other kind friends. She is pretty well,
and joins in sending cordial respects and thanks.――My young man returns
his. Letters from those you mention, will be very acceptable. I hope to
write to several shortly. I must now away; but not before I have wished
Mr. _Gillespie_ joy. The Pope I find has turned Presbyterian. O this
power, when got into wrong hands, what mischief does it occasion! “The
LORD reigns:”――that is enough for us. Adieu. My love to your honoured
father, and all dear friends. Accept the same in the tenderest manner
from, my dear _Timothy_,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCCXV.


                            _To Mr. H――――._

                                              _London, June 9, 1752._

_My very dear Friend_,

I Have received and read your manuscripts; but for me to play the
critic on them, would be like holding up a candle to the sun. However,
before I leave town, I will just mark a few places as you desire,
and then send the manuscripts to your brother. I foretell their
fate: nothing but your scenery can screen you. Self will never bear
to die, though slain in so genteel a manner, without shewing some
resentment against its artful murderer. I am glad you have written to
_South-Audley-street_. You are resolved not to die in my debt. I think
to call your intended purchase WESTON, and shall take care to remind
him by whose means he was brought under the everlasting gospel. O that
Doctor _S――――_ may be brought out to preach it! If you do not take
the other living yourself, I think your giving it to the Doctor is a
glorious scheme. I lay at your brother’s house last week: your sister
seemed to love to talk of JESUS CHRIST and her own heart. She got up
early, and came after me and my wife to Madam _T――――_’s. You know how
to improve this hint at a proper season. Your brother hath been so kind
as to let me have the little mare again. My Master walked, I ride to
preach the glorious gospel. Whether riding or walking, LORD JESUS, let
my whole heart be taken up with thee! Adieu, my dearest Sir, adieu.
Cease not to pray for,

                           Ever yours whilst
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXVI.


                            _To Dr. S――――._

                                              _London, June 9, 1752._

_My dear Doctor_,

GLAD shall I be to hear that you are a poor despised preacher of the
everlasting gospel. I long to direct _to the Reverend Mr. S――――_. I
believe if you once was gone so far that you could not retreat, you
would do very well. If Mr. _H――――_ does not take the two livings, I
think your scheme is glorious. May the LORD thrust you out some way or
another! I am sure the harvest is great: people seem more eager than
ever to hear the word. May I die preaching! Next _Thursday_ se’nnight
I leave _London_, and purpose to take a long circuit. I should be glad
to see you in the mean while. O that the love of CHRIST may burn all
the love of the world out of your heart! Adieu. Never fear the Bishop:
let your eye be only on the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls! He
will make your way plain. I must away. Business obliges me to hasten
to subscribe myself, dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXVII.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                             _London, June 12, 1752._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

THIS day about noon I received your Ladyship’s wished-for letter, which
brought me the welcome news of your Ladyship’s safe arrival at _Bath_.
May the waters be abundantly blessed to the restoring of your bodily
health, and may the comforts of the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS,
fill and refresh your soul! Your Ladyship judges right of dear Mr.
_Z――――_: he is a blessed man, a father in CHRIST indeed! I hope to
see both him and your Ladyship, about the twenty-fourth of this month.
Next week, GOD willing, I shall go to _Portsmouth_, from thence to
_Bath_, then to the West, then to _Wales_, and from thence, may be,
to _Scotland_ and _Ireland_. O that I could fly from pole to pole
publishing the everlasting gospel! Every day we hear of fresh conquests
gained. Grace! Grace! Yesterday I had several pleasing particulars told
me about _Georgia_. The having my work so divided, is a great trial
to me; but what is undertaken for GOD, ought to be carried on for him.
He can and will do wonders for those who put their trust in him. O for
faith, precious faith! It is all in all. Old times seem to be coming
about here. My body is much enfeebled, but the joy of the LORD is my
strength. Hoping shortly to see your Ladyship prospering both in soul
and body, and begging a continual interest in your Ladyship’s prayers,
I subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCXVIII.


                            _To Mr. I――――._

                                             _London, June 16, 1752._

_Dear Mr. I――――_,

YOUR last letter brought strange things to my ears, and put me upon
considering how to act. You know, my dear friend, that I hate to head
a party, and that it is absolutely inconsistent with my other business,
to take upon me the care of societies in various parts. I therefore
cannot promise to come to _Ireland_ for that purpose, neither do I
ever intend to engage in building any houses. My intention is to come
your way, but whether it will be this summer or not I cannot tell.
Mr. _A――――_ was very desirous of seeing you and his sister, and goes
through _Wales_ to _Ireland_. As you seem to have taken _Skinner’s
Alley_, I suppose he may preach there, and if a larger place could be
procured, I doubt not of its being filled. The LORD direct you how to
act, so as most to promote his glory, and the good of souls.――I hope
you will all, if possible, avoid the very appearance of a party spirit,
and evidence to the world, that the principles we hold are indeed of
GOD, by their moulding us more and more into the divine image. This is
indeed all in all. I hope the people here are in a growing way. Glory
be to GOD, we have happy days. What shall we render unto the LORD?
All he requires, is our poor hearts. May he have them without reserve!
My hearty love to your wife, Mr. _C――――_ and his wife, and all that
love CHRIST JESUS in sincerity. If I am prayed over, come I must. The
LORD be with you. I am so wearied by preaching, &c. that I can scarce
subscribe myself, my dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXIX.


                            _To Mr. L――――._

                                         _Portsmouth, June 19, 1752._

_Dear Sir_,

YOUR kind letter I received immediately after my last return to
_Scotland_, but I was so exceedingly busied in preparing for my
voyage to _America_, that I had not time to answer it. Being once more
unexpectedly brought back to my native country, I send my sincere,
though late acknowledgments, and hope this will find you and yours,
fighting the good fight of Faith, and resolved never to desist, till
you have laid hold on eternal life. Let not what has happened, draw off
your mind from the Captain of your salvation. He is altogether lovely,
and worthy of your highest regard. But alas! All his servants, even
the best of them, are but weak fallible men at the best. Happy they,
who by seeing the imperfections of the creature, are led to adhere
more closely to the all-sufficient and most adorable Creator. If you
and yours are taught this lesson by past occurrences, you will have no
reason to complain, but on the contrary will be excited to praise him,
who causes, that out of the eater there shall come forth meat, and out
of the strong shall come forth sweetness. Be pleased to accept this in
love. I send my most cordial respects to your whole self and family,
and beg their and your prayers in behalf of, dear Sir,

              Your affectionate friend and ready servant,
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCCXX.


                            _To Mr. T――――._

                                         _Portsmouth, June 19, 1752._

_My dear Friend_,

I Thank you for your very kind letter, and thank the LORD of all Lords
for honouring dear Mr. _G――――_. Now he will do more good in a week,
than before in a year. Where the carcase is, there the eagles will be
gathered together. Last _Monday_ we sung for him the following lines;

              _Give him thy strength, O GOD of power,_
              _Then let winds blow, or thunders roar;_
              _Thy faithful witness shall he be,_
              _’Tis fixed――he can do all through Thee._

How blind is Satan! What does he get by casting out CHRIST’s servants?
I expect that some great good will come out of these confusions. We
wait for thy salvation, O LORD! I hope your soul prospers. I long to
see you, and my other _Scotch_ friends, but question whether I can
come this summer. The LORD direct me to act as shall be most conducive
to his glory and the good of souls! We have had blessed seasons in
_London_; there I must be again in about a fortnight. On next _Tuesday_
the Trustees give up _Georgia_ to the King; the King of Kings has
appeared for _Bethesda_. I cannot think of seeing it again, till next
year. In the mean while you must pray that I may be busy for CHRIST.
And in so doing you will strengthen the hands of, my dear, dear friend,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXXI.


                            _To Mr. N――――._

                                            _Bristol, July 13, 1752._

_Very dear Sir_,

I Am quite sorry to hear that you are so much indisposed. But what
shall we say? The LORD JESUS orders all things well. He knows of what
we are made; he remembers that we are but dust. As our day is, so shall
our strength be. I see more and more, that, like our great Exemplar,
we must be made perfect through sufferings. Ere long, the time of
reigning will come, and one sight of the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS,
will make amends for all. O glorious prospect! Well might the apostle
say, “that the sufferings of this present time, are not worthy to
be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us.” _O gloriam
quantam et qualem!_ Courage then, my dear Sir; he that cometh will
come, and will not tarry. I dare not give vent; business obliges me
to be short. Here, as well as at _London_, the fields are white, ready
unto harvest. This week I pass over to _Wales_. I am a poor, but happy
pilgrim. Thanks be to free grace for it. My dutiful respects await good
Lady _Jane_, and the young Ladies. Be pleased to accept the same from,
very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXXII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                            _Cardiff, July 17, 1752._

_My very dear Friend_,

WHEREVER I am, you and yours, you and your kindnesses, are always upon
my heart. I think of them at my down-sitting and mine up-rising, and to
refresh myself, must express my gratitude. Indeed I thank you both ten
thousand times, and as a poor tribute, I send you word that the LORD of
all Lords is pleased to smile upon, and bless my feeble labours. I was
at _Bristol_ four days, and preached nine times. To my great surprize,
thousands (very near as many as attended at _Moorfields_) came out
every evening to hear the word. A blessed influence attended it; and
I have reason to believe much good was done. Old times seemed to be
revived again. Praise the LORD, O my soul! The last evening it rained a
little, but few moved. I was wet, and contracted a cold and hoarseness;
but I trust, that preaching will cure me again. This is my grand
Catholicon. O that I may drop and die in my blessed master’s work!

              _For this let men revile my name,_
              _I’ll shun no cross, I’ll fear no shame;_
              _All hail reproach, and welcome pain;_
              _Only thy terrors, LORD, restrain._

I am now entering upon _Wales_. What success my Master gives me, you
may hear some time hence. I beg your prayers, that I may be kept from
robbing GOD of his glory, or of any more of my precious time. What
said my dear Mr. _S――――_ when I saw him last? What!――“You the biggest
robber? No, no,――I am the man.” But thanks be to GOD, as you observed,
“our judge is our advocate.” I thank you for the hint. The LORD give me
to improve it! Farewell! I must soon away, to preach about eight miles
off. We have had a comfortable meeting this morning. My tender love to
dear Mrs. _S――――_ and your little daughter; accept the same in the most
endearing manner from me, who in the strongest terms that words can
express, am, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCXXIII.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                     _Haverford-west, July 25, 1752._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

AS this is the first day of rest from journeying, since my coming into
_Wales_, and also the extent of my _Welch_ circuit, I must not omit
sending your Ladyship a few lines. They inform your Ladyship of the
continued goodness of my blessed master, to the most unworthy servant
he ever sent forth. As my day, so hath my strength been. Abundance of
souls, especially in _Pembrokeshire_, have attended; and I hope that
seed hath been sown, which will spring up to eternal life. On _Monday_
next, I shall begin to return back, and some time this day sevennight
hope to wait upon your Ladyship at _Clifton_. On the following day,
I propose to preach at _Bristol_, and the next day shall set out for
_Gloucestershire_, to keep an association there. The LORD help me to
hold on and hold out unto the end! I dread the thoughts of flagging
in the latter stages of my road. JESUS is able to keep me from being
either weary or faint in my mind. In him, and in him alone is all
my strength found. I hope your Ladyship finds both your bodily and
spiritual strength repaired day by day. That you may mount on wings
like an eagle, walk and not be weary, hold on and not be faint, is the
continual prayer of, ever-honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ever
                            ready servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXXIV.


                         _To Mr. R―――― W――――._

                                     _Haverford-west, July 25, 1752._

_Dear Sir_,

I Love and honour you too much, to have let yours lie so long
unanswered, had not travelling and preaching prevented me. This is the
only quiet day that I have had for a long season. At _London_, the work
seemed to be as it were but just beginning. At _Bristol_ we had blessed
seasons indeed, and in _Wales_ the fields are white, ready unto harvest.
Had I not been pre-engaged in these parts, I should certainly have
come, and mounted my despised throne. I love state too well, especially
in _Scotland_, not to take it upon me as often as possible. I think
sometimes, that it is almost a pity one cannot have more bodies and
more souls. They should all run about, and be employed for JESUS.
What an honour to be employed in doing or suffering for him? Happy Mr.
_G――――_; I fancy he must preach quite well now. I dare say, you had no
hand in casting him out; GOD forgive those that had. In heaven there
will be none of this stuff. Thanks be to GOD, the church is militant
only here below. The LORD help us to fight the good fight of Faith,
till we lay hold on life eternal! Dear Mr. _H――――_ hath taken up his
weapons again; he is now Rector of a parish, and preaches twice every
Lord’s day. I thank you and yours, for your kind invitation of us to
your pleasant villa; had I wings I could fly thither to talk of JESUS,
and sing an hymn, but the cloud seems to move westward, and I fear my
visit to beloved _Scotland_ must be deferred till next spring. May the
LORD enable me to fill up every hour, every moment with duty! I believe
dear Mr. _R――――_ had a narrow escape the other day: if with you, pray
remember me to him and his, in the kindest manner. I most heartily
salute all enquiring friends, beseeching you all, for JESUS CHRIST’s
sake, never to cease praying for, reverend and very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXXV.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                           _Bristol, August 1, 1752._

_My very dear Friend_,

SINCE I wrote my last, I have been off my horse but one day. The
glorious _Emmanuel_ hath carried me through the _Welch_ circuit in
peace and comfort. In the fortnight past, from my leaving this place,
I preached twenty times, and have travelled above three hundred miles.
Congregations were very large. Last Lord’s day was a high day indeed;
the number of hearers at seven in the morning, as well as in the
evening, at _Haverford-west_, was almost incredible. The LORD was in
the midst of them. My body was weak in speaking to them, but JESUS hath
strengthened me again. O that I was humble and thankful! In my way
hither, we held an association; there were present about nine clergy,
and near forty other labourers. I trust all are born of GOD, and
desirous to promote his glory, and his people’s good. All was harmony
and love. Yesterday I came here. It is fair time, and to-morrow, GOD
willing, I purpose to expose the gospel wine and milk to sale. This I
have been doing this morning. O that the hearers may be made to come
down to the price, and willing to be saved by grace:――GOD knows I have
nothing else to depend upon.

              _Grace!――it’s a sweet, a charming theme,_
              _My soul exults at JESU’s name;_
              _Of him, who did salvation bring,_
              _I could for ever speak and sing_.

But how poorly do I speak of and for him? GOD be merciful to me a
sinner! He does show he will have mercy, and therefore it is that I am
not consumed.

                _If all the world his goodness knew,_
                _They must adore and love him too._

Blessed be GOD for manifesting himself to us, as he doth not unto the
world! You will join in crying Grace! Grace! Grace! Love bids me to
enlarge, though business obliges me to be brief. In about ten days I
hope to be in _London_. In the mean while, pray accept these poor lines
as a token of love unfeigned, and of grateful respect, from, my very
dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXXVI.


                            _To Mr. F――――._

                                             _London, Aug. 17, 1752._

_Dear Mr. F――――_,

INCLOSED you have a letter for Mr. _R――――_. I hope that promotion
will do him no hurt. May GOD help him to make a stand against vice
and prophaneness, and to exert his utmost efforts in promoting true
religion and virtue! This is the whole of man. I find that you grow
more and more famous in the learned world. As you have made a pretty
considerable progress in the mysteries of electricity, I would now
humbly recommend to your diligent unprejudiced pursuit and study the
mystery of the new-birth. It is a most important, interesting study,
and when mastered, will richly answer and repay you for all your pains.
One at whose bar we are shortly to appear, hath solemnly declared, that
without it, “we cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.” You will excuse
this freedom. I must have _aliquid Christi_ in all my letters. I am
yet a willing pilgrim for his great name sake, and I trust a blessing
attends my poor feeble labours. To the giver of every good gift be all
the glory. My respects await your whole self, and all enquiring friends,
and hoping to see you yet once more in this land of the dying, I
subscribe myself, dear Sir,

          Your very affectionate friend, and obliged servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCXXVII.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

              _Chester in the street, near Newcastle, Aug. 28, 1752._

_My very dear Mr. S――――_,

THUS far hath a good and gracious GOD brought a poor and worthless
pilgrim on his way towards _Edinburgh_. Last Lord’s day I preached
twice at _Lutterworth_, the famous _John Wicliffe_’s parish, and have
since received a letter giving me an account of the Redeemer’s blessing
my poor labours. On the _Monday_, I began in the name of the almighty
husbandman, to plow up some fallow ground at _Leicester_; several
thousands attended, and some endeavoured to disturb us, but the
opposition was nothing like what I expected. In the evening all was
hushed, and I trust our LORD left a blessing behind us. In my way to
_Lutterworth_, my heart was encouraged by the coming of a young man,
who had been awakened under my preaching about four years ago at
_Oulney_. He was before that time a bitter scoffer, but hath now been
a student for a year and a half under Doctor _Doddridge_, and I believe
will be admitted into the _London_ academy. You may know more of him
hereafter. Is not this as much as to say, “Go forwards.――In the morning
sow thy seed, and in the evening with-hold not thy hand, since though
knowest not which may prosper, this or that.” Yes, my blessed JESUS,
through thy grace strengthening me, I will continue to go out into the
highways and hedges; only vouchsafe to uphold me with thy right hand,
and keep me from flagging in the latter stages of my road. I know you
will say, _Amen_ and _Amen_. This will increase my obligations, which
are already more than I can express. GOD will reward both you and yours
for them, a thousand fold. Accept repeated thanks for repeated favours,
and depend on hearing as often as possible, how the ever-lovely,
ever-loving JESUS is pleased to deal with, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCXXVIII.


                            _To Mr. B――――._

                                          _Newcastle, Aug. 30, 1752._

_My dear Mr. B――――_,

YOUR last kind letter came to hand, only a few days before I left
_London_. Business prevented my answering it then: accept a few lines
from hence. They leave me on my way to _Scotland_. Thither the cloud
seemed to move, and I purpose to call on you, GOD willing, in my return
to _London_. Could you meet me at _Leeds_? I have thoughts of coming
that way back. I have written to Mr. _S――――_, and as I expect to see
him, you need say nothing about the books. I wrote also to Mr. _G――――_.
A short interview will settle every thing. Do not let my friend be
so solicitously anxious about persons or things. “The LORD reigneth,”
was the answer that _Luther_ sent to over-careful _Melancthon_. Never
fear.――Our LORD knows how to over-rule all for good. So that his work
goes on, let you and I be content to be forgotten, nay to be trodden
under foot, and slighted by our own spiritual children and friends.
This is bitter, but wholsome physic. The all-wise physician I trust
will make us drink it, till every evil, fretful, and uneasy temper be
purged out of us. Let us then, my dear man, chearfully take the cup
out of his blessed hands, and leave all to Him. A word to the wise is
enough. I must not enlarge. How goes on brother _W――――b_? I hope he
does not preach in a controversial way; I suppose I shall see him in
the North. My stay in _Scotland_ will be about a month. You may direct
for me at _Edinburgh_. I hope that a door is opened at _Leicester_
and _Lutterworth_ for field-preaching. We have had glorious seasons in
_Gloucestershire_ and _London_. O for a good gate in the North! It is
harvest time.――All hands to work. My love to Mrs. _B――――_ and all that
love CHRIST, whether they think in all things as I do or not. I send Mr.
_――――ly_ my cordial respects, and beg you to accept the same from, my
dear Mr. _B――――_,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXXIX.


                           _To Lady H――――._

                                         _Edinburgh, Sept. 22, 1752._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

THE day after I wrote to your Ladyship, I left _London_, and in my way
to _Scotland_ I preached twice at _Lutterworth_.――The auditories were
very numerous, and very quiet; but at _Leicester_ some turnips were
thrown at me during the first sermon; at the second all was hushed, and
I hear since that good was done. Some of _Ashby_ society came thither
to hear me. At _Aberford_ I called on Lady _Margaret_, who behaved
very friendly, and enquired much after your Ladyship’s welfare. At
_Newcastle_ I was, as it were, arrested to stay. ♦I preached four times,
and indeed a whole shower of divine blessings descended from heaven on
the great congregations. I came hither last _Wednesday_ was sevennight,
and have preached twice a day in the open air, to very large and polite
auditories. Abundance of the better sort constantly attend. Next
_Tuesday_ I thought to move, but they have prevailed upon me to stay
a little longer. I hope the great GOD will give me a useful journey
back again to _London_. I design keeping from thence as long as I can,
before I go into my Winter quarters. Alas, how little is to be done
even in the Summer season! One had need work whilst it is day; the
night comes on a pace, when no man can work. I need not tell your
Ladyship of this, who are always employed for your GOD. O that the
rich and great would learn to copy after your example! Surely all your
Ladyship’s efforts will not be lost upon them! My heart’s desire and
continual prayer to the LORD of all Lords is, that your Ladyship may
be long continued, and find your rod budding and blossoming more and
more every day. Hoping to send your Ladyship more good news in my next,
and commending my poor unworthy self to your Ladyship’s prayers, I beg
leave to subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,

_My very dear friend_,

AS you are no day out of my thoughts, so you must needs think it hath
seemed a long time since I wrote to you last. But what has hindered me?
Not want of love, but opportunity. For this fortnight last past, I have
been preaching twice every day at _Edinburgh_, where a great multitude,
as well of polite as common sort of people, attended continually. I
wondered they were not wearied, but the more they heard, the more they
seemed desirous of hearing. Many young ministers and students were
close attendants, and I trust through grace good has been done. I
expected to have left _Scotland_ as last _Tuesday_, but through the
importunity of friends have been prevailed on to come to _Glasgow_, and
shall not return for _England_ till _Tuesday_ sevennight. Then I hope
to begin to preach my way up to _London_. In this blessed delightful
work, I hope to live and die; I think it is worth dying for. The LORD
make me sensible of the honour put upon me, and lay me lower at his
feet every day, every hour, and every moment! I have here a flaming
minister that is my friend, and I hear sweet work is going on in the
highlands. Praise the LORD, O our souls! Inclosed you have a letter
from the young student mentioned in my last. I think it is a pity that
such a youth, when pious students are so much wanting, should go back
to business for want of a little help. I doubt not but the LORD will
provide for him some way or other. He generally brings those low,
whom he intends to exalt, and make use of. I have glad tidings from
_Newcastle_ and _Leicester_. Methinks every thing concurs to bid me go
out into the highways and hedges.

              _LORD, at thy command I’ll go,_
              _And unto sinners gladly tell,_
              _That they a risen CHRIST may know,_
              _That they the love of CHRIST may feel._

This is a heaven upon earth. Of this, I pray the GOD of love to give
you and yours a double portion. I know you pray for me. I send you and
your dear yoke-fellow ten thousand thanks, and am, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Madam_,

IT is no small pleasure to me, that providence hath once more opened a
way for a further correspondence with one, who for many years hath been
my friend, and strengthened my hands in the work of our common LORD
and master JESUS CHRIST. He will richly reward you for it in the great
day of accounts; though I am persuaded you think the work itself, its
own reward. Indeed it is. Blessed be GOD, I find CHRIST’s service to
be perfect freedom. He hath vouchsafed to encourage and comfort me in
_Scotland_. At _Edinburgh_ great multitudes, among whom were abundance
of the better sort, attended twice every day. After a short continuance
here, I am to return to _Edinburgh_, and next _Tuesday_ sevennight
purpose to set out for _England_. Many young ministers and students
have given close attendance, and I hear of several persons that have
been brought under deep convictions. As soon as they are put into my
hands, I intend to send you copies of two letters from a High-land
schoolmaster, who is honoured of GOD to do much good among the poor
Highland children.――By this post I have also sent a letter to Mr.
_D――――_, which I received from a young student; he wants some little
assistance, to help him to go on in his studies, but I did not send
his letter to you, because he informs me that you had taken one of
Mr. _G――――_’s spiritual children under your care. Blessed be GOD, that
makes you, Madam, a mother in _Israel_. Every student’s name is Legion.
Helping one of those, is helping thousands. I think this young man’s
case, as laid down in the letter, is very remarkable, and matter of
praise. LORD JESUS add to the blessed number, for thy great name’s
sake! I have brave news sent me from _Leicester_ and _Newcastle_, and
have strong invitations to _Yorkshire_ and _Lancashire_. What a pity
is it, that the year goes round so soon? O my GOD, my GOD in CHRIST,
how little can I do for thee! Dear Madam, be pleased to increase my
obligations by praying for me. I never forget you or your ♦houshold,
and as a proof of it, promise that you shall hear at all opportunities,
from, dear Madam,

           Your most affectionate, obliged friend, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Mr. A――――_,

I Received your kind letter, but till now have not had time to answer
it. However, I have not, and, GOD willing, shall not be unmindful of
you. I think you have nothing to do, but by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving, to make your wants known unto GOD. He careth for
you, and will some way or other provide both for soul and body. I have
always found him a present help in every time of need. As means ought
to be used, I have just written to some _London_ friends, who under GOD
may serve you. When we meet, you shall hear what success.――The hearts
of all are in CHRIST’s hands. Wait on him, and your eyes shall behold
his great salvation. If he calls you to the ministry, as I hope he
does, he will make your way plain. The cloud of his providence shall
go before you, and you shall hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is
the way, walk in it.” Though your father should die, and your mother
forsake you, the LORD JESUS CHRIST will take you up. Keep close to your
GOD, and your book. Prayer, reading, meditation, and temptation make a
minister. The LORD be with you. Pray for me, and assure yourself of my
being, for CHRIST’s sake,

              Your affectionate friend and ready servant,
                                                              _G. W._

_Dear Sir_,

MR. _S――――_, in a letter, insists upon my sending you a few lines:
I care not to refuse him, and yet I know not well how to use so much
freedom. If it be too great, you will excuse it; it proceeds from love,
love to your better part, for I have nothing to write about, but the
invisible realities of another world. These I trust, dear Sir, you and
yours will be experimentally acquainted with more and more every day.
Herein lies all our present peace, and the only solid preparation for
future comfort in the coming world. The love of JESUS shed abroad in
the heart by the Holy Ghost, is indeed all in all; this is glory begun;
this is the opening of the kingdom of heaven in the soul; this is
a never-failing well of water, which will at last spring up to life
eternal. And yet all this is the gift, the free gift of GOD in CHRIST
JESUS. It cost him dearly, even his own heart’s blood, but flows down
to us in a free channel; yea and that too even to the very chief of
sinners. Therefore I have hope, and, blessed be GOD, good hope through
grace. Is not the same grace, dear Sir, sufficient for you and yours?
Let us then come boldly to CHRIST’s throne. He sits encircled with a
rainbow; his name and his nature is Love. He came into the world, to
seek and save those that feel themselves lost; this I trust you do.
Salvation then is just coming to your soul, even a present and great
salvation. Only believe, and yours is the kingdom of heaven. But
whither am I running? I forget myself when writing of redeeming love. O,
my dear Sir, do not rest, do not let GOD have any rest, till your heart
is filled with it. It is worth asking, seeking, knocking, and striving
for. But I must have done. My cordial respects await your Lady. That
you may both go on hand in hand to heaven, is the hearty prayer of,
dear Sir,

              Your affectionate friend and ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

THUS far hath a never-failing Redeemer brought me in my way towards
_London_. With all humility and thankfulness of heart I desire to set
up my _Ebenezer_: for surely hitherto hath the LORD helped me. Since my
writing last to your Ladyship, I went and preached for about a week at
_Glasgow_, where the word of the LORD ran and was glorified. I preached
twice a day, and rather more attended than at _Edinburgh_. We had
a sorrowful parting at both places. For about twenty-eight days, I
suppose I did not preach to less than ten thousand every day. This
hath weakened my body, but the Redeemer knows how to renew my strength.
At present, I am as well as a pilgrim can expect to be. About seventy
pounds were collected for the _Edinburgh_ orphans, and I hear that
near a dozen young men that were awakened about ten years ago, have
since entered upon the ministry, and are likely to prove very useful.
Praise the LORD, O my soul!――In my way hither, I preached at _Berwick_,
_Alnwick_ and _Morpeth_; and next _Monday_, after preaching at
_Sunderland_, as is intended, I am to go into _Yorkshire_. I know your
Ladyship wishes me much prosperity. That your Ladyship may prosper
more and more, and be in health both in soul and body, is the continual
prayer of, ever-honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,

_My very dear Friend_,

SINCE I left _Newcastle_, I have scarce known sometimes whether I
have been in heaven or on earth. At _Leeds_, _Burstall_, _Howarth_,
_♦Halifax_, &c. thousands and thousands have flocked twice and thrice
a day to hear the word of life. A gale of divine influence hath
every where attended it. I am now come from _Bolton_, _Manchester_,
_Stockport_ and _Chinly_.――Yesterday I preached in a church, where
I believe execution was done. Four ordained ministers, friends to
the work of GOD, have been with me. The word hath run so swiftly at
_Leeds_, that friends are come to fetch me back, and I am now going to
_Rotheram_, _Wakefield_, _Leeds_, _York_, and _Epworth_, and purpose
returning to this place next Lord’s day. GOD favours us with weather,
and I would fain make hay whilst the sun shines. My dear Sir, pray
follow me with your prayers. Fain would I spend and be spent for
the good of souls. This is my meat and drink. The LORD bless you and
yours! I can no more, but only subscribe myself, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

I Have been upwards of three weeks out of _Scotland_, but scarce ever
had more encouragement in preaching the everlasting gospel, since the
LORD of the harvest was pleased to send me forth into the harvest.
At _Newcastle_, _Sunderland_, and several places in _Yorkshire_,
_Lancashire_, and _Cheshire_, thousands and thousands have daily
attended on the word preached. The glorious _Emmanuel_ caused life
and power to follow it, and I hear that the arrows have stuck fast
in many hearts. The stir hath been so great at _Leeds_, that at the
desire of friends, I am returning thither again. From thence I shall
go to _York_, and several places in _Lincolnshire_, and am to preach at
_Sheffield_ next Lord’s day. My return to _London_ must be determined
by the weather. It hath been uncommonly favourable, and methinks it
is pity to go into Winter quarters, so long as work can be done in the
fields.――O that I had as many tongues, as there are hairs upon my head!
The ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS should have them all. Be so good,
honoured Sir, to pray that he may not turn me out of his service, but
employ me as a poor pilgrim till I die. Fain would I die preaching.――I
hear that Mr. _H――――_ is gone. The LORD JESUS quicken my tardy pace,
and prepare me to follow! I know you say _Amen_ in my behalf, and
thereby add to the obligations you have already laid upon, honoured and
dear Sir,

        Your most affectionate, though unworthy son and servant
                        in the glorious gospel,
                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

THROUGH the good providence of an ever-lovely, ever-loving Redeemer, I
came safe hither last night. My _Sunday_’s work, sickness, the change
of weather, and affecting parting from friends, so enfeebled this
tottering tabernacle, that I was in hopes on the road the imprisoned
soul would have been set at liberty, and fled to those blissful regions,

              _Where pain, and sin, and sorrow cease,_
              _And all is calm and joy and peace._

At _Northampton_ I took coach, and am now, blessed be GOD, arrived
at my Winter quarters. My poor wife I found an invalid. Our LORD
can restore her, for he came to heal our sicknesses, and bear our
infirmities. I hope this will meet my dear friend and his wife leaning
on this all-sufficient, never-failing _Emmanuel_. I have remembered you
ever since my departure, and now, with groanings that cannot be uttered,
pray that your souls, and the souls of all the dear people around
you, may prosper and increase with all the increase of GOD. O, my dear
friend, what manner of love is this, that _we_ should be called the
sons of GOD! Excuse me. I must pause a while.――My eyes gush out with
water. At present they are almost fountains of tears. But thanks be to
GOD, they are tears of love. O what shall I do for Him who hath loved
and given himself for ill and hell-deserving, ungrateful, unfruitful
me! Add to my obligations by praying for me! My unfeigned love to Mr.
_L――――_. If I can, he shall soon hear from me. With the box for Mr.
_G――――_, I shall send a few pictures, which you may present to Mr. and
Mrs. _N――――_, as you think best. O that the blessed and divine image
of the adorable JESUS may be stamped in most lively colours on all
our hearts! It will, it will. JESUS is the author, and he is also the
finisher of our faith. Let us not be faithless but believing. Let us
not trust in ourselves, but in him who hath promised never to leave nor
forsake us. I can no more. The LORD be with you and yours.――My hearty
love to all that love CHRIST JESUS in sincerity; accept the same in the
most tender manner from, my very dear friend,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

LAST night the glorious _Emmanuel_ brought me hither, after having
given me and his dear people many blessed seasons in _Scotland_, and
the North of _England_. O that with all his other mercies, he may
vouchsafe to give me a thankful and humble heart! This morning I have
been talking with dear Mr. _A――――_, and cannot help thinking, but
that you have run before the LORD, in forming yourselves into a public
society, as you have done. I was afraid poor Mr. _C――――_ would not do.
Mr. _A――――_’s visit was designed to be transient, and I cannot promise
you any settled help from hence. I am sincere, when I profess, that
I do not choose to set myself at the head of any party. When I came
last to _Ireland_, my intention was to preach the gospel to all.――And
if it should ever please the LORD of all Lords to send me thither
again, I purpose to pursue the same plan. For I am a debtor to all
of all denominations, and have no design, if I know any thing of this
desperately wicked and deceitful heart, but to promote the common
salvation of mankind. The love of CHRIST constrains me to this.
Accept it as wrote from that principle. That He, who is the wonderful
counsellor, may in all things direct and rule your hearts, is the
earnest prayer of, my dear friend,

                      Yours most affectionately,
                                                              _G. W._

_My very dear Friend_,

I Am quite sorry that I missed seeing you, but glad and thankful that
you condescended to write to me. I find you are resolved to outdo me
in love; this I would prevent if possible. May the glorious JESUS shed
abroad his love abundantly in your dear heart, by the Holy Ghost, and
give you to increase with all the increase of GOD. He will bless you
for vindicating the honour of his sacred volumes in your last pamphlet,
for which, as well as for all other unmerited favours, I most heartily
thank you. I have just now read it, and doubt not of its being greatly
blessed and owned, and going through many editions. I cannot discern
any errata or inaccuracies in the composition. Surely GOD hath raised
my dear friend up, to let the polite world see how amiable are the
doctrines of the gospel. Why will you weary the world, and your friends,
by delaying to publish your other long wished-for performance? Glad
shall I be to peruse any of the dialogues. The savour of the last is
not of my mind. Pray let them see the light this Winter. They will
delight and warm many a heart. O that we may have a warm season at the
Tabernacle! My country circuit was exceedingly delightful. When the
weather altered, my health was much affected; but a little rest hath
already in some degree repaired it. You and I perhaps are not to see
heaven as yet: I have waited for it long, but alas! my appointed time
is not yet come. Thanks be to GOD, there is such a thing as having a
heaven upon earth; CHRIST in us is the heaven of heavens. My dear, very
dear friend, good night. I am called away. My love to the Doctor. O
that he was wise! How glad should I have been to have seen dear Mr.
_H――――_! My kind respects await your mother and sister. My wife, who is
quite an invalid, joins heartily with me, who am, my very dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Nat_,

YOUR letters have all been brought safe to hand, and have given me no
small satisfaction. I doubt not but the LORD, whom you seek, will in
his own time come and visit the temple of your heart. Fear not, neither
be dismayed. Be found in the way of duty; go on feeding his lambs, and
you shall find, that the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls will bless
and comfort you. I know not of a more profitable situation, that you
could be in than at present. Next year, GOD willing, you will have a
fellow-student. I have agreed with him, as I wrote you from _Edinburgh_,
for three years at least. I am of your mind in respect to boarders.
As affairs stand, I think the less the family is at present, the
better. Nothing seems to be wanted but a good overseer, to instruct
the negroes in sawing and planting. Let me know how Mr. _M――――_
behaves, and whether the Lumber trade is begun. I have consented
to Mr. _E――――_’s going to Mr. _Z――――_, and to _Margaret_’s leaving
_Bethesda_. You will see what I have wrote to Mrs. _W――――_. Pray make
_George_ and the children to write often. He should not have written
to me, _Honoured Master_, but――_Sir_. I am glad to hear that some of
the children promise well. Surely some good will in the end come out of
that institution, I am only afraid of its growing too great one day or
another, in a worldly way. O that I may be directed to such managers,
that will act with a single eye to GOD’s glory, and his people’s good!
I have great confidence in you. I am glad you live in peace. May the
Prince of peace cause his grace and mercy to be multiplied upon you!
I shall be glad to live to see you a preacher. It is a delightful
employment, when done out of love to JESUS: that sweetens all. In
about ten weeks I have travelled above a thousand miles, and was
enabled to preach sometimes twice and thrice a day to many thousands.
I trust a great blessing was left behind with the word preached. O that
_Georgia_’s wilderness may blossom like a rose! It will, when GOD’s set
time is come. Never mind a few evil reports. No one need be ashamed of
_Bethesda_ children. Blessed be GOD, they are taken care of, and the
LORD will reward you. Ah my dear _Nat_, you are highly honoured. I hope
you often bow down before the blessed Redeemer, and out of the fulness
of your heart say, “Why me, LORD? why me?” Pray, pray, I beseech you
continually, that you may be cloathed with humility. How many young
men have I known ruined for the want of it! “GOD resisteth the proud,
but giveth grace unto the humble.” Pray that I may have an humble and
thankful heart. I would vie with a seraph, if I could, in humility
and thankfulness. Adieu. The LORD be with you! My wife sends her love;
accept the same from, my dear _Nat_,

              Your most assured friend for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXLI.


                         _To Mr. V―――― B――――._

                                             _London, Nov. 22, 1752._

_My dear Mr. V―――― B――――_,

I Hope this will find you and your yoke-fellow parents of a living
and well-formed child. May the Redeemer sanctify it from the womb,
and cause it to live to his glory, and your comfort! I see you are
taught to live more and more by faith. This may be tried, but never
disappointed. The LORD JESUS never did, and never will forsake those
who put their trust in him. I believe Mrs. _W――――_ will not suffer you
or yours to want any thing that _Bethesda_ affords. I thank you for
your kind offer, but suppose ere now you have been enabled to purchase
some negroes, and go upon your own land. If not, I have written to
Mr. _B――――_ to make what agreement you shall mutually judge to be most
proper: I cannot say more at this distance. It is hard to determine any
thing four thousand miles off. GOD willing, I hope to see you next year;
though it is difficult to leave thousands and ten thousands, who gladly
receive the gospel, to come to a wilderness, where it has been, alas!
too, too often most wretchedly despised, and slighted by many. But I
trust we shall yet see better times. Happy they who have learned to
live on JESUS; and by keeping up a daily and hourly fellowship with him,
can maintain a comfortable frame, when all is cold and dead around them.
This is the happiness I wish my dear Mr. _B――――_. May it increase day
by day, moment after moment! Then, if we never should see each other
again on earth, we shall meet, never to part again, in the kingdom of
heaven. I am endeavouring to call as many thither as I can. Power seems
to attend it, and many seem to have their faces set _Zion-ward_. May
they and we be kept from looking back! JESUS is able to keep us. To his
almighty never-failing mercy do I commend you, as being, my dear Sir,
for CHRIST’s sake,

         Your most affectionate friend, brother, and servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXLII.


                            _To Mr. L――――._

                                             _London, Nov. 28, 1752._

_My dear Friend_,

YOUR letter came safe to hand yesterday. The contents of it humbled
and gladdened me, and led me directly to my knees, to intercede for you
and yours, and all the dear people at _Leeds_, who are either seeking
after, or have actually found redemption in the blood of JESUS. Many
here, blessed be GOD, are in like circumstances. Our LORD seems to
ride triumphantly on in the chariot of his everlasting gospel; and the
shout of a king is indeed amongst us. Blessed are the eyes that see the
things which we see. What shall we render unto the LORD? Our two mites,
a vile body, and a sinful soul, are all that he requires: and shall he
not have these? Yes, I trust the language of both our hearts is this:

              _Be gone, vain world, my heart resign,_
              _For I must be no longer thine;_
              _A nobler, a diviner guest,_
              _Now claims possession of my breast._

As this is your case, I wonder not at your being so solicitous for
your dear children’s welfare. The LORD give you faith and patience,
and help you in every respect so to behave, that you may win them over
to the choice of true and undefiled religion! Courage, my dear brother,
courage.――Who knows, but they may be made willing in a day of the
Redeemer’s power? He that hath given your dear yoke-fellow a heart to
seek after the pearl of great price, can make your children like-minded.
But faith must be tried, patience must be exercised, and our stubborn
will brought into a chearful resignation to the holy sovereign will and
good pleasure of GOD.

                _What though thou rulest not,_
                _Yet heaven, and earth and hell_
                _Proclaim GOD sitteth on the throne,_
                _And ordereth all things well._

A variety of business prevents my enlarging. I should not have troubled
you with such a speedy answer, had you not seemed to desire it, as a
token of my love. I think it is cordial and unfeigned. None of you are
forgotten by me before the throne. There, my dear friend, let us meet
often. Remember it is a throne of grace; we may, therefore, come with
boldness. JESUS is our advocate, even JESUS CHRIST the righteous. I
thank you ten thousand times for all respect shewn me for his great
name’s sake, and command you (since love will make you wait for orders)
to believe me to be, my dear Sir,

       Your very affectionate friend, brother, and ready servant
                    in our common but dearest LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCXLIII.


                            _To Mr. ――――._

                                              _London, Dec. 5, 1752._

_My dear Friend_,

HOW does love meet love! Your long expected letter came last night, and
as the box of books hath been gone some days, I answer you before day
this morning. My dear friend, good-morrow! Blessed be GOD, that the day
dawns, and that the day-star hath risen in your heart. May the Redeemer
give you a _Benjamin_’s mess every hour! He is our great _Joseph_, and
loves to say to his guilty brethren, “Come near me.” Out of his fulness
we may all receive even grace for grace. O how does he continually
watch over us for good! I thought the obstructions that lay in my way
to _York_, were not for nothing. Our times are in our LORD’s hands. We
are immortal till our work is done. This, this shall be the cry of my
soul:

              _LORD, at thy command I’ll go,_
              _And to the world will gladly tell,_
              _That they a risen CHRIST may know,_
              _That they the love of CHRIST may feel._

Assured of such a bidding, we may say with _Luther_, “If there was as
many devils lying in wait, as there are tiles on the houses, we need
not fear.” Who knows but in Spring we may have a fair field fight? We
can do all things through CHRIST strengthening us. Methinks I long to
range in your parts, and come to _Leeds_ again. The persons mentioned
need not bid me to remember them. I cannot forget either them or you
night or day. O that we may make some large advances in the divine life,
before we see each other. When will that be? Perhaps in Spring; perhaps
not till we meet in heaven.

              _There we shall see CHRIST’s face,_
              _and never, never sin;_
              _There, from the riches of his grace,_
              _Drink endless pleasures in._

Hasten, LORD, that blessed time! Till then, grant us, we beseech thee,
an heaven upon earth! Such we have at the Tabernacle indeed. Last
Lord’s-day we had, if possible, a more blessed sacrament than the
former.

                _How sweet, how awful was the place,_
                  _With CHRIST within the doors,_
                _When everlasting Love display’d,_
                  _The choicest of his stores!_

I must break off this delightful subject. Farewel. Pray for us.
Remember me in the kindest manner to all. My wife heartily joins with

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXLIV.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                              _London, Dec. 9, 1752._

_My dear Brother_,

IF your heart was full, so was mine when we parted. Such seasons make
me long for that happy time when we shall neither part from each other,
nor depart from the blessed JESUS any more. Our wanderings and tossings,
fightings without, and fears within, will then all be over. Here the
church is, and will be militant; in heaven it shall be altogether
triumphant. Let us go on, my dear brother, fighting the good fight of
faith. Ere long we shall be called to lay hold on life eternal. CHRIST
is our captain; we are therefore assured of conquest.

              _A feeble saint shall win the day,_
              _Though death and hell obstruct the way._

Endeavour to obstruct they will, and young converts little know how
resolutely, how unweariedly. The way to heaven is a round-about way:
we must go through a wilderness. GOD suffers this, to prove and try
us, and to shew us what is in our hearts. Humility must be taught us,
as _Gideon_ taught the men of _Succoth_, with briars and thorns: these
will frequently fetch blood from the old man. O that we may be made
willing to have him bleed to death! “Away with him, away with him;
crucify him, crucify him.” May this be the language of your heart and
mine! To have this prayer answered, what trials must we necessarily
meet with from the devil, the world, the flesh, and even from GOD’s own
children? All little enough to lead us into that mortified, pacific,
resigned, and disinterested mind, which was in CHRIST JESUS. The more
we suffer, and the less we are esteemed for doing, or attempting to
do good for his great name’s sake, the more we are conformed to his
blessed example. In heaven, justice will be done to all. Strange! that
we cannot wait more patiently till the great day of retribution. LORD,
help us to walk more by faith, and less by sense! “Help, O help us to
leave ourselves and all with thee.” I know you will say, “_Amen_!” But
I forget myself. How willingly does the pen write, when love, love for
CHRIST’s sake dictates and indites! I thank you for enquiring after my
welfare: thanks be to GOD, I am as well as a poor, but happy pilgrim
can expect to be. The shout of a king is amongst us. The glory of the
LORD fills the Tabernacle; and we hear every day of persons brought
under fresh awakenings, as well as of GOD’s people being comforted. We
have had two most awful sacramental occasions. Help me to cry, Grace!
grace! I shall be glad to hear that the gospel runs and is glorified at
_Wakefield_. Who knows but the last may be yet first? Is any thing too
hard for the LORD? Continue to remember us at the throne of grace; and
accept this speedy answer as a token of respect and love unfeigned,
from, my dear brother,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXLV.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                             _London, Dec. 15, 1752._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

I Think it a long time since I heard from, or wrote to your Ladyship.
My hands are full of work; and I trust I can say, the LORD of all lords
causes his work to prosper in my unworthy hands. More blessed seasons
we never enjoyed. Our sacramental occasions have been exceedingly awful
and refreshing. I cannot help crying out night and day, Grace! grace!
Last week we had another repast in _South Audley-street_. Lady _F――――_
grows surprizingly. She increases much in the knowledge of herself,
and of JESUS CHRIST. May she and all that profess to love him, increase
with all the increase of GOD! I have glorious news from _Yorkshire_.
Inclosed your Ladyship hath a letter, which I hope will please you.
Ships will be going to _Philadelphia_ soon after _Christmas_. Has your
Ladyship read the awful account of the hurricane in _South-Carolina_? I
do not find that it hath reached _Georgia_. Happy they who have laid up
treasure in heaven, and have fled to CHRIST for refuge; such are safe
from every storm. This is your Ladyship’s happiness; and blessed be GOD,
this is the happiness of unworthy, ill, and hell-deserving me. LORD,
why am I a guest?

                  _Through all eternity to Thee,_
                  _A grateful song I’ll raise;_
                  _But O eternity’s too short,_
                  _To utter all thy praise._

Business prevents my enlarging.――I commend your Ladyship, and all your
concerns, to the tender mercies of a never-failing Redeemer; and beg
leave to subscribe myself, with all possible gratitude and respect,
ever-honoured Madam,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCXLVI.


                           _To Mrs. K――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 16, 1752._

_Dear Mrs. K――――_,

YOUR kind letter lies by me unanswered, because I had written to
your dear husband just before it came to hand. Ere now I hope he
hath received it with the books, and is with you, and the other true
followers of our most adorable Redeemer, pressing forwards towards the
mark of the prize of our high calling in CHRIST JESUS. O that nothing
may hinder us in this heavenly race! O that we may remember _Lot_’s
wife, and never look back! Alas! what is there in this world worth
looking back upon? It is nothing, less than nothing. Thanks be to
that precious CHRIST, who hath redeemed us out of it. To Him that
hath thus loved us, be ascribed all honour and glory now and for
ever! My obligations to bless and magnify our LORD increase daily. It
would delight you to see, how his glory is manifested among his poor
despised ones. To-morrow we are again to celebrate the memorials of
his dying love. O that we may be prepared according to the preparation
of the sanctuary! Blessed be GOD for a compleat and an everlasting
righteousness to appear in; this is the wedding garment; this every
poor sinner is cloathed with, that truly puts on the LORD JESUS. Well
may such despise outward ornaments, and trample upon the pride of life.
Such things are food only for those that know not GOD. Go on then, dear
Mrs. _K――――_; go on, all ye my female fellow-soldiers, who are lifted
under the Redeemer’s banner. As your day is, so shall your strength be.
Look up continually to JESUS; and be so good as always to remember,
when before his throne,

                Your assured friend and ready servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCXLVII.


                         _To Governor B――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 20, 1752._

_Honoured Sir_,

WITH great pleasure and satisfaction, I received and read your kind
letter, and took the first opportunity of transmitting the inclosed to
good Lady _H――――n_, who is now near _Bristol_. If the ship which brings
this, doth not sail soon, I believe your Excellency will have an answer
by the same conveyance. She is an elect lady indeed; one who hath
fairly renounced the world, and scorns to divide her affections between
it and her GOD. Her Ladyship corresponds with the Dutchess of ――――,
but I fear that the latter doth not glory in the cross of CHRIST, so
much as might be wish’d. You know, honoured Sir, that we must have true
self-denial, and a disinterested spirit, before we can be sincerely
willing to be accounted fools for CHRIST’s sake. And yet there is no
going to heaven without it. Blessed be GOD, your fight, honoured Sir,
is almost over; the days are now coming wherein you must necessarily
say, “I have no pleasure in them.” The 71st psalm, translated by Dr.
_Watts_, seems to be sweetly adapted to your circumstances. Part of it
was lately sung for your Excellency, by many true followers of the Lamb.

                                I.

            _Still hath his life new wonders seen,_
              _Repeated every year;_
            _Behold his days which yet remain,_
              _We trust them to thy care._

                                II.

            _Cast him not off, should health decline,_
              _Or hoary hairs arise;_
            _And round him let thy glories shine,_
              _Whene’er thy servant dies._

I doubt not but the LORD JESUS will say, _Amen_. Whether I shall have
the pleasure of seeing you on this side eternity, is uncertain. It was
no small self-denial for me to leave _America_ without going to the
_Northward_; but the cloud moved towards _England_. Here (O amazing
condescension!) the glorious _Emmanuel_ vouchsafes still to own and
bless my feeble labours. In _Scotland_, _Wales_, and the parts in and
near _Yorkshire_, we have seen blessed days of the Son of Man. I am
now in my Winter quarters, longing for Spring, to take the field again.
Had I a thousand tongues and lives, JESUS should have them all. I am
sorry, quite sorry that not one of his ministers could venture over
the _Atlantick_ for _New-Jersey_ College. Two general collections have
lately been made upon other occasions in _Scotland_. What a pity, when
all circumstances concurred, that such a favourable opportunity should
have been lost? I can only lament that, which I did all I could to
prevent. And now, honoured Sir, I must bid you farewel. Ere long I
hope to see you in a better world: perhaps we may meet again in this.
Dear _America_ is much upon my heart. Thanks be to GOD, _Bethesda_ is
now put on a good and flourishing foundation, and I hear hath escaped
the late hurricane in _South-Carolina_. Great are thy judgments, O
GOD;――and great are thy mercies also! both past finding out. To the
infinitely great and gracious I AM, do I most earnestly commend both
you and yours, and with ten thousands thanks for all your unmerited
favours, I beg leave to subscribe myself, honoured Sir,

          Your Excellency’s most obliged, dutiful, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCXLVIII.


                          _To Captain G――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 20, 1752._

_My dear Captain_,

ONE would imagine, that you and I were never to meet any more on
this side eternity. I often, often think of you, and long to see and
converse with you; but GOD only knows when. We are now about to erect
a _new Tabernacle_ eighty foot square, which I fear will detain me in
_England_ the ensuing Summer. Pen cannot well describe, how white the
fields have been, and how ready to harvest, in _Wales_, _Scotland_, and
the _North_ of _England_. I could sometimes scarce tell, whether I was
in or out of the body. Grace! grace! I am now in Winter quarters, where
our LORD gives us fresh conquests, gained by his word every day. We do
not dispute, but love. I find more and more that truth is great; and
however seemingly crush’d for a while, will in the end prevail. But
there must be a kind of death upon every promise, and upon every thing
that is done for GOD. Thus hath it been with _Georgia_ and _Bethesda_.
O that we may learn to wait! Then shall we certainly see the salvation
of GOD. I pity our dear friends in _Charles-Town_. O GOD, how great
are thy judgments, as well as thy mercies! May they hear the rod, and
who hath appointed it! My soul is distressed for them. May this severe
correction make them truly great! When you send any thing to _Savannah_,
I should be obliged to you, if you would send a few things to
_Bethesda_. Our LORD will bless you for it. I hope there are now above
twenty negroes at work upon the new plantation. May the LORD JESUS
convert them, and every other member of my family! And O that I may be
converted myself more and more every day and hour! I am ashamed of my
being such a dwarf in religion, and of my having so little of the mind
of CHRIST. I hope you, my dear old friend, do find his grace sufficient
for you, to keep your heart above the world, and continually alive to
GOD. My prayer for you is, that you may have power to get wealth, and
grace to improve it for the Redeemer’s glory, and his people’s good:
then you will be rich for both worlds, and GOD, even your own GOD,
will give you and yours his blessing. Why do you not write to dear
Mr. _S――――_? He is a heavenly-minded man indeed, and my bosom friend.
I suppose Mr. _D――――_ will acquaint you of my having been at his house;
we are kind friends still: he and his very much regard you. What cannot
GOD do? How faithful is he to those, who “seek first his kingdom,
and the righteousness thereof.” Let these words be written over your
store-house door; or rather let them be written on the table of your
heart. I can add no more. A variety of business demands my attention.
My dear man, farewel. Had I wings, I would fly and see you, and my
other never to be forgotten _Philadelphia_ friends. Continue to pray,
and perhaps I may yet come sooner than expectation. My wife joins in
sending love to you and your houshold. Accept the same in the most
endearing manner, from one that loves you more than a brother, even

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

I Have read and pondered upon your kind letter with some degree of
solemnity of spirit. In the same frame I would now sit down to answer
it. And what shall I say? Really I can scarce tell. The connection
between you and your brother, hath been so close and continued, and
your attachment to him so necessary to keep up his interest, that I
would not willingly for the world do or say any thing that may separate
such friends. I cannot help thinking, but he is still jealous of me
and my proceedings; but, I thank GOD, I am quite easy about it. Having
the testimony of a good conscience, that I have a disinterested view
to promote the common salvation only, I can leave all to him, who I
am assured will in the end speak for me, and make my righteousness as
clear as the light, and my just dealing as the noon-day. I more and
more find, that he who believeth doth not make haste; and that if we
will have patience, we shall find that every plant, which our heavenly
Father hath not planted, however it may seem to have taken very deep
root, shall be plucked up. As I wrote to good Lady _H――――n_, so I write
to you, dear Sir.――I bless GOD for my stripping seasons. I have seen
an end of all perfection, and expect it only in him, where I am sure
to find it, even in the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS. He knows how I
love and honour you, and your brother, and how often I have preferred
your interest to my own. This, by the grace of GOD, I shall still
continue to do. My reward is with the LORD. If he approves, it is
enough. More might be said, were we face to face. When this will be,
I cannot tell. Several things, especially our design of building a new
tabernacle, which I hope will succeed, detain me in town this Winter.
GOD only knows what course I am to steer in the Spring. I would be a
blank;――let my heavenly Father fill it up as seemeth him good. I am
glad you are with our elect Lady; she will shine indeed in heaven as
a common friend. O how amiable is a truly catholic spirit! LORD, make
us all partakers of it more and more! I beg the continuance of your
prayers: I need them much. GOD willing, you shall have mine in return.
That you and yours may increase with all the increase of GOD, is the
earnest request of, my dear friend,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCCL.


                           _To Lady H――――n._

                                             _London, Dec. 22, 1752._

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

WITH great pleasure I received your Ladyship’s letter, which hath drawn
me to the Father of Spirits, that the meek, lowly, loving, zealous, and
heavenly-minded temper which was in CHRIST JESUS, may be stamped more
and more upon your Ladyship’s heart. A growth in these blessed graces
and fruits of the divine Spirit, I am persuaded is what your Ladyship
desires above all things under heaven, and I doubt not but all the
trials and afflictions you meet with, both from friends and foes, will
be sanctified to the promoting this glorious end. Many of these I meet
with; but if I come purified out of the furnace, and am at length any
way conformed to my dear and blessed Exemplar, I rejoice, yea and will
rejoice. Experience, if attended with this effect, cannot be bought too
dear. But alas, how unwilling is the old man to be crucified and slain!
How hard is even the mind that is renewed in part, how hard to be
brought off low and selfish and party views. With how much reluctance
doth it give up the uppermost place, and submit to be accounted in the
church, as well as in the world, less than the least of all. Yet this
is a lesson the witnesses of JESUS must learn. O that I had learnt only
my A B C in it! I beg the continuance of your Ladyship’s prayers, for
which I thank your Ladyship a thousand times. May the LORD of all lords
return them seven-fold into your bosom, and give your Ladyship success
in your endeavours to serve the persons mentioned in your last! It is
but for your Ladyship to try. I shall observe your Ladyship’s hints
about Mr. ――――. I believe our visits will not be very frequent.――But I
am easy, having no scheme, no design of supplanting or resenting, but I
trust a single eye to promote the common salvation, without so much as
attempting to set up a party for myself. This is what my soul abhors.
Being thus minded, I have peace; peace which the world knows nothing of,
and which all must necessarily be strangers to, who are fond either of
power or numbers. GOD be praised for the many strippings I have met
with: it is good for me that I have been supplanted, despised, censured,
maligned, judged by, and separated from my nearest, dearest friends. By
this I have found the faithfulness of him, who is the friend of friends;
by this I have been taught to wrap myself in the glorious _Emmanuel_’s
everlasting righteousness, and to be content that He, to whom all
hearts are open, and all desires are known, now sees, and will let all
see hereafter, the uprightness of my intentions towards all mankind.
But whither am I going? I run too fast. Your Ladyship’s kind letter
hath extorted this from me. I will weary your Ladyship no longer, but
hasten to subscribe myself, what I really am, ever-honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and very
                  chearful servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                            LETTER DCCCCLI.


                            _To Mr. R――――._

                                             _London, Dec. 22, 1752._

_My very dear Friend_,

WITH great pleasure I received your kind and wished-for letter;
and heartily bless GOD that your whole self is in such comfortable
circumstances, and that honest _D――――_ is so blest in his work. I read
his two letters about ten days ago, and many joined in singing for him
the following verses:

                  _The isles in the North,_
                  _Remember, O GOD,_
                  _And feed thy sheep there,_
                  _With pure gospel food_.
                  _LORD, revive thy blest work_
                  _In every place,_
                  _Till thousands and thousands_
                  _Do triumph through grace._

Do you not think the blessed JESUS will say, _Amen_? Yes, assuredly he
will. And if he will work, who shall hinder?

                _Thoughts are vain against the LORD,_
                _All subserve his mighty word;_
                _Wheels encircling wheels shall run,_
                _Each in course to bring it on._

Fear not, my dear Sir; if CHRIST hath work for you to do, he will put
you into a proper station. But would you be a _Nehemiah_, and have no
_Sanballat_ to oppose you? Building the walls of the _New-Jerusalem_,
is what the profane and formalists do not approve of. We must expect
the serpent will hiss, whenever the gospel seed of the woman is coming
into a place to bruise his head. Courage, my dear Sir, courage. GOD is
on your side.

                  _The world, with sin and Satan,_
                  _In vain our march opposes;_
                    _Through CHRIST we shall_
                    _Break through them all,_
                  _And sing the song of |Moses|._

You see, my dear Sir, how freely I write. The love of CHRIST
constraineth me. I am much indebted to you, and hope to see you in
_London_ soon. My wife longs to have you under our roof: she hath
been ill, but blessed be GOD is now better. We both send cordial and
grateful respects to your whole self and all enquiring friends. We
have had most solemn sacramental occasions. I sympathize with both our
suffering friends: from what unexpected quarters do troubles come! Who
would sing a requiem to himself, whilst here below? LORD GOD, prepare
us for whatever thou hast prepared for us! I must bid you farewel. A
variety of business obliges me to hasten to subscribe myself,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCLII.


                          _To Lady ♦H――――n._

                                              _London, Jan. 1, 1753._

_Honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship’s kind letter hath added to the obligations already
laid on me. I can only say, the LORD knows that you and yours, are
remembered by me before his throne. This is the reward, which the
Redeemer promises to those who do good to a disciple, in the name of
a disciple. O happy they who are rich in faith and good works! These
are the true riches; they are durable; they follow us beyond the grave,
and we shall be reaping the fruit of them through the endless ages of
eternity. Eternity! eternity! The very writing or hearing this word,
is enough to make one dead to the world, and alive unto GOD. The LORD
quicken my tardy pace! I am now thirty-eight years of age, and entering
upon another new year; Alas! alas! How little have I done for that
JESUS, who hath done and suffered so much for me! I want to begin to
begin to act and preach for GOD. Blessed be his name, that his spirit
is moving on precious souls at _Bristol_. For ever adored be his rich,
free, and unmerited grace, the same may be said of _London_. We have
had blessed holidays, and I have had good news from the Orphan-house.

              _A life that all things casts behind,_
              _Springs forth obedient at his call._

Had I a thousand lives, the LORD JESUS should have them. I wish your
Ladyship, and honoured daughters, much of his divine love shed abroad
in your hearts. That is the best new year’s compliment, and the best
new year’s gift. I hope, the young ladies through grace are kept
unspotted from the world. I would come and wait upon our elect Lady
at _Clifton_, but am engaged in forwarding the building of a new
tabernacle; I hope it will be accomplished, and that GOD’s presence
will fill it when erected. I could enlarge, but am called away, and
therefore subscribe myself,

           Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged, and ready
                      servant for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

                                              _London, Jan. 3, 1753._

_My very dear Friend and Brother_,

THOUGH I am very much straitened for time, yet I must sit down, (since
you so earnestly desire it) and answer your kind letter. My love does
not shift with my scene of action; I would have it in some degree, like
my LORD’s to me and his people, “Permanent and unchangeable.” Blessed
be GOD for such a JESUS, who is the same yesterday, to-day, and for
ever. What can we want then? Or of whom should we be afraid? All his
attributes are engaged to keep us on earth, and to set us upon thrones
in his glorious kingdom in heaven. Last night I buried one, who I
believe is seated there.――Ah lovely appearance of death! Surely my turn
will come soon. I am now thirty-eight years of age; little did I think
of staying in the land of the dying so long. Well, if it be to call
more souls to the ever-loving, ever-lovely JESUS, Father, thy will be
done!

                _If thou excuse, then work thy will,_
                _By so unfit an instrument;_
                _It will at once thy goodness show,_
                _And prove thy power omnipotent._

I hope you have had a happy _Christmas_ at _Leeds_. We have kept
holidays here indeed. Sinners have been pricked to the heart, and
saints refreshed in their spirits. To the Father of spirits be all
the glory. I forgot none of you in my poor prayers: fear not; let us
continue to pray, and we shall always find, that our extremity will
be GOD’s opportunity to help and appear for us. But there must be a
seeming death upon every promise.

              _Where reason fails with all its powers,_
              _There faith prevails and love adores._

LORD, increase our faith.――LORD, quicken my sluggish heart! I commend
you and yours to GOD, and to the word of his grace. I am sorry dear Mr.
_S――――_ is disabled from writing. When his hand is well, I hope to hear
from him. In the mean while, tell him, and his, and all dear friends,
that I am, for CHRIST’s sake, my dear Sir,

                       Theirs and yours, &c. &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCLIV.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                                              _London, Jan. 7, 1753._

_My dear Mr. C――――_,

I Received your kind letter, for which I send you most hearty thanks.
I see that you strive, and I fear you will succeed, to outdo me in
love and kindness. However, I will endeavour to copy after you, and, if
possible, not die in your debt. But who can ever pay his debt of love,
either to GOD, or the brethren? Alas! Alas! I run in arrears every
day. GOD’s favours are continually multiplied upon me, and he seems to
let us know that we shall see greater things than ever. We have had a
blessed _Christmas_ season. I trust our LORD hath imparted many a new
year’s gift. You know what that is, even a _new heart_. “A new heart
also will I give thee.” Thus run the words of our LORD’s last will
and testament. O for faith to prove this will! O for a willingness to
receive so invaluable a legacy! LORD, I believe, help my unbelief!

          _Thou wilt give strength, thou wilt give power,_
            _Thou wilt in time set free;_
          _This great deliverance let us hope,_
            _Not for ourselves but thee._

Come, my dear brother, let us take courage: “He is faithful, who hath
promised, who also will do it.”

              _O unbelief, injurious bar,_
              _Source of tormenting, fruitless care._

Surely it is the womb of misery, and grave of comfort. Had we faith but
as a grain of mustard seed, how should we trample the world, the flesh,
the devil, death, and hell under foot? LORD, increase our faith! I know
you say _Amen_. “Even so LORD JESUS, Amen and Amen!” But whither am
I going? Love makes me forget myself. Adieu――my dear Sir, adieu. Pray
tell Mr. _G――――_ that I intend answering his kind letter shortly. I
send cordial love to him, and all the followers of the Lamb.

                _O may we find the ancient way,_
                  _Our wond’ring foes to move;_
                _And force the heathen world to say,_
                  _See how these christians love!_

I can now no more, but subscribe myself, dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

                                              _London, Jan. 7, 1753._

_My very dear Friend_,

BY this conveyance I send you a power of attorney to dispose of
_Providence Plantation_, and leave it to your discretion to sell at
what price you please. I would only observe, that I had rather it
should be sold for somewhat less than its real value, than to keep it
any longer in my hands. I do not choose to keep two families longer
than needs must. Be pleased to pay what you receive for it, into the
hands of Mr. _Charles H――――n_ of _Charles-Town_. Blessed be GOD for
remembering mercy in the midst of judgments. O that with his rod he
may also send his spirit! For without it, as dear Mr. _V―――― B――――_
observes, “We shall be chastened, but not changed.” The world after the
deluge, was as bad as before. Nothing but the blood of JESUS CHRIST,
applied by faith, can cleanse the soul from sin.――

              _To this blest fountain of thy blood,_
                _Incarnate GOD I fly;_
              _Here let me wash my spotted soul,_
                _From sins of deepest dye._

My dear Sir, add to my obligations, by praying, that the foot of pride
may never come against me. This is what turned fair angels into foul
devils; and yet alas, how prone are we to it! Surely it is the first
enemy we fight with, and the last that is totally conquered. O that I
was humble! then would the LORD delight to own and honour me more and
more. I am amazed he doth not throw me aside. But (O unchangeable love!)
still he causeth my rod to bud and blossom. The Winter season hath
been very blessed, and we hear daily of fresh inroads made into Satan’s
kingdom. GOD seems determined to throw down _Jericho_’s walls by
rams-horns, yea by very crooked rams-horns. Even so, Father, for so
it seemeth good in thy sight! My dear Sir, once more I intreat you to
pray for me. Neither you nor yours are forgotten by me. The money you
receive for _Providence_, will be immediately wanted to buy more land,
and to pay for opening _Bethesda_’s new plantation.――I have desired
your brother to agree with Mrs. _P――――_ for hers, if she can give a
good title. I am sorry to hear she is declining.――But why so? Is not
death an entrance into life everlasting?

              _There sin and pain, and sorrow cease,_
              _And all is calm and joy and peace._

Hearty love and prayers attend her and all enquiring friends. That this
new year may be filled with millions of new blessings, both to your
souls and bodies, is and shall be the constant prayer of, very dear
Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCLVI.


                            _To Mr. S――――._

                                              _London, Jan. 9, 1753._

_My dear Mr. S――――_,

I Received your kind letter yesterday, and suppose, ere this can
reach you, my last will be come to hand. What say you? If I should be
detained in _England_ this year, are you willing to put your life in
the Redeemer’s hands and go immediately? A ship is bound for _Savannah_
about ten miles from the Orphan-house, the beginning of next month.
Methinks I hear you say to the glorious _Emmanuel_,

              _A life that all things casts behind,_
              _Springs forth obedient at thy call._

Such a spirit is fit for _Bethesda_; such a spirit becomes one who
desires to be a teacher of youth, and a faithful minister of the
ever-loving ever-lovely JESUS. Let me know your mind. If you come
immediately, may the LORD come and go with you! That is company enough.
――But there are others going in the same ship. The LORD direct and
bless you! He will vouchsafe to countenance my feeble labours. I have
yet more good news from the North. Last night was an awful night, we
carried three saints together to the grave; thousands attended, and
both within and without doors, the word I trust came with power. O
that the dead may be made to hear the voice of the Son of GOD, and to
come forth! I rejoice if any of his dear people have been quickened at
_Glasgow_. Perhaps next Summer, I may see them in my way to, or return
from _Ireland_. The LORD help all to pray for me. “Less than the least
of all,” shall be still my motto. To me nothing belongs, but shame and
confusion of face. I must away. The LORD direct and bless you. I
commend you to his never-failing mercy, and am

                Your assured friend for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCLVII.


                            _To Mr. Z――――._

                                             _London, Jan. 10, 1753._

_Honoured and very dear Sir_,

THIS morning, before I received your kind packet, I was finishing
my answer to the good Professor, and then intended to send it to you
with the inclosed extracts. LORD, what am I, that any of thy faithful
servants should write to, or concern themselves about me or my affairs!
With all thy other favours, give me, O GOD, an humble and grateful
heart; so shall thy mercies not prove my ruin! I hope to answer good
Mr. _U――――_ and dear Mr. _B――――s_ speedily. A ship goes to _Savannah_
the ♦beginning of next month. Mrs. _V―――― B――――_ is safely delivered of
a daughter; the forts being destroyed by the late dreadful hurricane,
the Governor and Council of _South-Carolina_, have sent for her husband
to _Charles-Town_. Blessed be GOD, _Bethesda_ hath received but little
damage. Several of the orphans have sent me pretty letters, and I trust
it will yet prove an useful seminary for both white and black persons.
I wait to see this great salvation, O LORD! To-morrow, GOD willing, I
shall dine with Mr. _L――――_, and on _Friday_ morning if possible will
endeavour to wait upon you. My hands are full of work, and I hear every
day of fresh persons awakened; but I can do so little, and what I do is
done so badly, that I fear sometimes my LORD will throw me aside like
a broken vessel.――Very dear and honoured Sir, for CHRIST’s sake do you
and your worthy collegue continue to pray for me; surely it is an act
of the greatest charity. Less than the least of all, shall be my motto
still. My heart is full; GOD forgive me. I am now beginning to enter
upon my thirty-ninth year. LORD JESUS quicken my tardy pace! I can no
more. But hoping to see you on _Friday_, and to be furthered in my work
and way by your fatherly counsel and instruction, I subscribe myself,
very dear and honoured Sir,

_Ever-honoured Madam_,

YOUR Ladyship’s very kind and christian letter, I have read over and
over again. It drew my heart towards the Redeemer, and caused me to
pray, that your present retirement, may be a glorious preparative for
further, and yet more public usefulness in his mystical body. To have
one’s hands or tongue tied from acting or speaking for GOD, is, to a
new and heaven-born soul, one of the greatest pieces of self-denial in
the world. But this hath been the lot of many of the most choice and
holy souls under heaven. It is a mercy, that where there is a willing
mind, it is accepted according to that which a man hath, and not
according to that which he hath not. I beg that your Ladyship would not
have the least thought about my concerns, otherwise than at a throne
of grace. Your Ladyship wants a bridle, rather than a spur. My highest
ambition is to spend and be spent for JESUS, and to be not the head,
but servant of all. When your Ladyship mentioned the word _ambition_,
I could not help thinking of the saying of the _Eunuch_, “Speaketh the
prophet this of himself, or of some other man?” But we know not what
is in our hearts. LORD, keep me from being led into, and falling by
temptation. I wish your Ladyship much success with _B――――_, but worldly
wise men, serpent-like, so turn and wind, that they have many ways to
slip through and creep out at, which simple-hearted single-eyed souls
know nothing of, and if they did, could not follow after them. Honesty
is the best policy, and will in the end (whether we seek it or not) get
the better of all. Your Ladyship’s intended letter to Governor _B――――_,
will be very acceptable. I hope the inclosed will give your Ladyship
pleasure. O that I may be enabled to give the LORD JESUS all the glory!
To me nought belongs, but confusion of face. Surely I am the chief of
sinners, less than the least of all saints, but for CHRIST’s sake,
ever-honoured Madam,

            Your Ladyship’s most dutiful, obliged and very
                            ready servant,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCLIX.


                            _To Mr. C――――._

                                             _London, Jan. 15, 1753._

_My dear Mr. C――――_,

I Owe you a letter and much love. The one I will now pay you, the other
debt our ♦common LORD must discharge. I despair of doing it, because I
run upon fresh arrears to him and his dear people every day and every
hour. I willingly therefore own myself a debtor to high and low, rich
and poor, to all, of all denominations whatsoever.――What have we to
do with a party or sectarian zeal? Why should not our heaven begin on
earth?

              _All that we know they do above,_
              _Is, that they sing, and that they love._

O for some fresh anointings of the blessed spirit! Then will the scales
fall more and more from our eyes, and the veil of ignorance be taken
more and more from our hearts. Then shall we be more and more content
to think, and let think, and be studious to be of one heart, where we
cannot be of one judgment or mind. The sweetness of such a spirit, is
unspeakable; it brings with it its own reward; it frees the soul from
a thousand needless jealousies, and selfish passions, and enables it to
put the reins of government into his hands, who alone orders all things
well. LORD, increase in us this spirit, and give us more and more to
love all that bear thy image, though they may not in all things agree
with us!

                _O may we find the ancient way,_
                  _Our wond’ring foes to move;_
                _And force the heathen world to say,_
                  _See how these christians love!_

My dear brother, your kind letter constrains me to write thus.――Blessed
be GOD for what has been done at any time, by any instrument, at
_Newcastle_. I still pray that the town may be full of new creatures.
In _London_ we have reason to rejoice. Yesterday was a great day of
the Son of man; both at the sacrament, and under the word preached,
our LORD gave us to drink of the wine of the kingdom. On _Monday_ last
we followed three believers to the grave, and triumphed over death on
his own ground. O what a CHRIST have we! GOD help us to love him more,
and serve him better! I salute all most heartily with whom you are in
fellowship.――Grace, mercy and peace be multiplied upon you. I beg a
continued interest in all your prayers, and subscribe myself, dear Sir,

              Your affectionate friend, and ready servant
                          for CHRIST’s sake,
                                                              _G. W._

_My dear Friend_,

A Multiplicity of business prevented my answering your kind letter,
before my coming out of _London_. Lest I should be prevented by the
same means at my return thither, I write you a few lines in the way.
I have been among some new-awakened souls, who seem to be taking the
kingdom of GOD by a holy violence. At _London_, GOD hath lately caused
his people’s cups to run over with strong consolation, and many sturdy
sinners have been made to cry out, “What shall we do to be saved?” I
thank you for the caution about the new building; a burnt child dreads
the fire. I shall not begin, till we have a thousand pounds in hand,
and then shall contract for a certain sum for the whole. This affair
will detain me till the days are long enough to travel, and set
out upon a fresh pursuit after poor sinners, who have wandered from
their GOD.――The LORD be with you and yours. May the gospel plough be
prospered, whatever hand is employed to lay hold of it. This, as far
as I know my treacherous heart, is the sincere language of, dear Sir,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCLXI.


                            _To Mr. O――――._

                                             _London, Jan. 23, 1753._

_My dear Mr. O――――_,

I Received your kind letter, and have since shewn it to the secretary
for _Georgia_, who approved of it very much. I am glad we are to have
you in that infant province, and could heartily wish you was nearer
_Bethesda_. I doubt not of its becoming a seat of learning in time,
but it is good for every thing to rise gradually. I have engaged a dear
youth, who I trust will suit the Orphan-house infant state very well.
It hath scarce learnt as yet to stand upon its own legs; as it grows I
expect it will give me more trouble. To have young men educated there,
and then turned out into the church graceless and unconverted would
break my heart. Father, if it be thy will, let this cup pass from me!
I suppose we shall now soon know, who is to be Governor; every thing
is to be ordered as I informed you in my last. My eyes are waiting upon
Him, from whom alone cometh all our salvation. We see wonders every
day on this side the water. Glorious days of the Son of man indeed!
Notwithstanding, I long to take another trip to yonder new world. Time
will determine, wherefore this attraction. He that believeth doth not
make haste. GOD forbid that “Chastened, but not changed,” should always
be _Charles-Town_ motto. LORD, let them hear thy rod, and who hath
appointed it! What a dreadful thing is it to come cankered out of the
furnace? It bespeaks further trials yet behind;――but I need not tell
you this.――Excuse this freedom: be pleased to give my hearty love to
all, and I beseech you continue to pray for, my dear friend and brother,

             Yours most affectionately in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._




                           LETTER DCCCCLXII.

                                             _London, Jan. 19, 1753._

_My very dear Sir_,

A Few days ago I was with good Mr. _Z――――_, who assured me that Mr.
_V――――_ had written him, that two hundred pounds sterling were ordered
you to be disposed of as you should judge proper. I hope you will find
this to be true, if you have not found it so already. Is there no way
of making the breach up between you and Mr. _B――――_? Mr. _U――――r_, from
whom I heard very lately, and also all your _German_ friends, desire
it extremely. I promised Mr. _Z――――_ that I would use my interest for
your own sake, but above all for the sake of JESUS CHRIST our common
LORD. My very dear Sir, do forgive and forget, and if you are conscious
you have been too hasty in any respect, pray send to Mr. _B――――_ a few
lines of love. We never lose any thing by stooping.――GOD will always
exalt the humble soul. O that the prince of peace would honour me to be
a peace-maker!――Do, my dear friend, comply with my request, and thereby
give further proofs that you are indeed converted, and become a little
child. May this blessing descend on your new-born babe! Our joint
respects await Mrs. _V――――_ and yourself. You may well wish yourself
at the tabernacle. All is alive there.――Thousands flock to hear, and
thousands feel the power of the living GOD.――Dear _Charles-Town_, I
pity thee! O that thou knowest the day of thy visitation! If this meets
you there employed as an engineer, may the LORD own, bless and direct
you, and keep you unspotted from the world! If elsewhere, I hope you
are where GOD would have you be, and that is enough,――I commend you
to his never-failing mercy, and desiring a continued interest in your
prayers, beg leave to subscribe myself, very dear Sir,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._




                          LETTER DCCCCLXIII.

                                             _London, Jan. 27, 1753._

_My very dear Friend_,

I Thank you a thousand times for the trouble you have been at, in
revising my poor compositions, which I am afraid you have not treated
with a becoming severity. How many pardons shall I ask for mangling,
and I fear murdering your dear _Theron_ and _Aspasia_? You will see
by _Monday_’s coach; which will bring a parcel directed for you, to
the care of Doctor _S――――_. It contains one of your dialogues, and two
more of my sermons, which I do not like very well myself, and therefore
shall not wonder if you dislike them. If you think they will do for the
public, pray return them immediately, because the other two go to the
press next _Monday_. I have nothing to comfort me but this, “that the
LORD chooses the weak things of this world to confound the strong, and
things that are not, to bring to nought the things that are.” I think
to sell all four sermons for six-pence. I write for the poor, you
for the polite and the noble; GOD will assuredly own and bless what
you write.――As yet I have only had time to peruse one of your sweet
dialogues; as fast as possible I shall read the rest. I am more than
paid for my trouble by reading them. The LORD be with your dear heart!
Continue to pray for me. The LORD be with us. Grace! Grace! I am,
dearest Sir, in very great haste, but greater love,

                              Yours, &c.
                                                              _G. W._

                                             _London, Jan. 31, 1753._

_Reverend and very dear Sir_,

YOUR kind letter came safe to hand, and according to your desire, I
send you a little bell, as a small token of my unfeigned love to your
dear congregation. I have written strongly to Professor _Frank_ for
some Negroes for you, and heartily pray the LORD of all Lords to put it
into our power to serve that black generation. Their souls are equally
precious in the eyes of an all gracious Redeemer, as ours. O that
we may yet see some good come out of _Georgia_. I would take another
trip over this spring, but am hindered by our building a new place of
worship, and by the continual calls that are given me to preach the
everlasting gospel.――Indeed we see most glorious days of the Son of man.
The cup of GOD’s people is made to run over, and every day we hear of
somebody or another brought under new awakenings, and pricked to the
heart; notwithstanding this, I find a continual attraction to _America_.
The event will prove wherefore all this happens to me. LORD help me
to walk by faith and not by sight! My dear Sir, you and yours will not
forget to pray for me. I am the chief of sinners, and less than the
least of all saints――What shall I render unto the LORD? Write every
opportunity. Dear Mr. _Z――――_ will take care of your child. Cannot
matters be made up between you and Mr. _V――――_? Is it not a pity that
any of us should fall out in our way to heaven? When we meet next,
remember that a floor and blanket is all the lodging, and a chick
or fowl, boiled or roasted, is all the food I desire at _Ebenezer_.
What is a pilgrim life without a pilgrim heart? O that I was like
my LORD! Then should I endure hardness, like a good soldier of JESUS
CHRIST.――The encouragement for raising silk will be continued. O
that _Georgia_ may prove a fruitful soil for raising children unto
_Abraham_! We wait for thy salvation, O LORD. For the present, reverend
Sir, adieu. My wife joins in sending cordial salutations to your
whole self, to Mr. _L――――_ and his wife, and all the dear people at
_Ebenezer_. That you all may at all times have reason to say, “hitherto
hath our LORD helped us,” is the earnest prayer of, reverend and very
dear Sir,

       Your most affectionate, though unworthy younger brother,
                and fellow-labourer in our common LORD,
                                                              _G. W._

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
