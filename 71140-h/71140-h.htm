    <i>My dear brother H――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Thank you for your kind and very agreeable letter. It was refreshing to my soul, and stirred me to give thanks on your behalf. I am surprized that you are not turned off, since you now so clearly preach the everlasting gospel. But our Saviour has the hearts of all men in his hands, and he turneth them when and wheresoever he pleaseth. O my dear brother, I hope nothing will deter you from preaching the glad tidings of salvation to a world lying in the wicked one. I would not but be a poor despised minister of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    for ten thousand worlds. This I am persuaded is the language of my dear friend’s heart:</p>

    has wonderfully of late interposed on their behalf. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I intend shortly to send you an account of the Orphan-house, and my last volume of sermons, with some other things. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for making any of my poor writings of use to your dear soul. Surely I had need proclaim free grace on the house-top; if I did not, the stones would cry out against me. O my dear brother, what a mystery of love is the mystery of godliness? Whilst I am writing the fire kindles. This fire has also of late kindled in many hearts. Our large society goes on well. We have many that walk in the comforts of the Holy Ghost. I hear of glorious things from various parts. I hope ere long we shall hear of persons going from post to post, and crying, “Babylon is fallen, Babylon is fallen.” I trust you, my dear Sir, will be made a happy instrument in the Mediator’s kingdom, of pulling down satan’s strongholds. Pray write me word, how the war is going on between <i>Michael</i> and the dragon. For the present, adieu. My tender love to all the lovers of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Accept the same from, my dear brother,</p>

    <i>To <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> R――, in Edinburgh.</i></p>

    <i>London, <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 24, 1742.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Dear Mr. R――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span>T has given me some concern that I could not answer your kind and acceptable letter before. As our Saviour will give me freedom, I shall send you a few lines now. I think I may say to you, as <i>Luther</i> said to <i>Melanchton</i>, <i
      lang="la">Nimis es nullus</i>.
    You are kept in bondage by a false humility. It is good to see ourselves poor, and exceeding vile; but if that sight and feeling prevent our looking up to, and exerting ourselves for our dear Saviour, it becomes criminal, and robs the soul of much comfort. I can speak this by dear-bought experience. How often have I been kept from speaking and acting for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    by a sight of my own unworthiness; but now I see that the
    <a id="p005"></a>more unworthy I am, the more fit to work for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    because he will get much glory in working by such mean instruments; and the more he has for given me, the more I ought to love and serve him. Fired with a sense of his unspeakable loving-kindness, I dare to go out and tell poor sinners that a lamb was slain for them; and that he will have mercy on sinners as such, of whom indeed I am chief. I wish my dear friend was in this respect not almost, but altogether such as I am. Well would it be with him, and happy would he then be. Upon the receipt of yours, I prayed the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    to open your mouth. The language of my heart for you, myself, and all the Redeemer’s witnesses, is this;</p>
  <div class="flexctnr txt_sm">
    <div class="metered">
      <p><i>Ah! <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, enlarge their
          scanty thought,</i></p>
      <p><i>To see the wonders thou hast wrought;</i></p>
      <p><i>Unloose the stammering tongue, to tell</i></p>
      <p><i>Thy love immense, unsearchable.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="in_00 quobrk">
    I bless our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> for giving you such freedom with himself, though you cannot speak so freely to others. Prayers wrought by his own spirit, he will hear and answer. It is most god-like to be frequent in intercession. It is the constant employment of the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in heaven. I rejoice to hear the work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    goes on among you in <i>Scotland</i>. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    it prospers in our hands here, in <i>Wales</i>, and in various places. That it may prosper more and more, and be daily carried on in your precious soul, is the hearty prayer of, dear <abbr

    <i>Dear Miss S――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">C</span>ONTINUAL avocations about my master’s business, has prevented my answering your kind letter. It gladdened my heart, because it brought me the glad tidings of your being accepted in the beloved; and knowing that you are so, what does the <span

    require of you now, but to walk humbly with him? Beg him to shew you more and more
    <a id="p006"></a>of your evil heart, that you may ever remain a poor sinner at the feet of the once crucified, but now exalted Lamb of <span

    The comforts you have already experienced, as well as your trials, are but earnests of what you will hereafter meet with in the spiritual life. But fear nothing, neither be over thoughtful for the morrow; you have an all-gracious and almighty Saviour to guide and protect you. He will not leave you, until he hath lodged you safe in glory. There the wicked shall cease from troubling, and your weary soul will enjoy an eternal rest. Perhaps I may not see you again, till I meet you in the world of spirits.

    <i>January 9, 1743.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Remember, when in <i>Scotland</i> last year, how heartily your good people joined in praise and thanksgiving, for the deliverance <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    had wrought out for the inhabitants of <i>Georgia</i>; and I hope I shall never forget how liberally they contributed to the necessities of the orphans, though they knew not but at that time both orphans and Orphan-house were in the enemies hand. As this was an uncommon event, I send you herewith part of the proclamation for a day of thanksgiving to almighty <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    for putting an end to this <i>Spanish Invasion</i>. It runs thus:</p>
  <p class="quobrk" id="p007">
    ALMIGHTY GOD has in all ages shewn his power and mercy, in the marvellous and gracious deliverance of his church, and in the protection of righteous and religious kings and states, professing his holy and eternal truth, from the open invasion, wicked conspiracies, and malicious practices of all the enemies thereof. He hath by the manifestation of his providence delivered us from the hands of the <i>Spaniards</i>: they, with forty sail of small gallies and other craft, came into <i>Cumberland</i> Sound; but such a terror came upon them that they fled. With another fleet of thirty-six ships and vessels they came into <i>Jekyl</i> Sound, and after a sharp fight became masters thereof; we having only four vessels to oppose their force. We engaged them for the space of four hours, and not one of us was killed, though many of the enemy perished, and five were killed by one shot only. They landed four thousand five hundred men, according to the account of the prisoners, and even of <i>Englishmen</i>, who escaped from them. The first party marched up through the woods to this town, and was within sight thereof, when <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    delivered them into our hands, though we were but few in number. They fought and were soon dispersed and fled. Another party which supported them, also fought; but were soon put to flight. We may truly say, the hand of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    fought for us; for in two attacks more than five hundred fled before fifty. At first they seemed to fight with courage; and the grenadiers particularly charged with great resolution; but their shot did not take place, insomuch that none of ours were killed; but they were broken and pursued with great slaughter, and by the report of the prisoners since taken, upwards of two hundred men never returned to their camp. They also came up with their half galleys towards the town, and returned without so much as firing one shot, leaving behind them some cannon, and many things they had taken. Twenty-eight sail attacked <i>Fort-William</i>, in which were only fifty men. After three hours fight, they went away and left the province, and were pursued as far as Saint <i>John’s</i>. So that by this whole expedition, no more than two of ours were taken and two killed. We may therefore truly say, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath done great things for us, who has delivered us out of the hands of the enemy.</p>
  <p id="p008">
    Having taken the premises into consideration, I do hereby order, that <i>Sunday</i> the twenty-fifth instant be observed as a day of public thanksgiving to almighty <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for his great deliverance, in having put an end to the <i>Spanish</i> Invasion: and that all persons do solemnize the same in a christian and religious manner, and abstain from drunkenness, and any other wicked and dissolute testimonies of joy.</p>

  <p>
    <i>My dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>N effectual door is opened in these parts. On <i>Saturday</i> night I preached here. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was with me. On <i>Sunday</i> morning I preached again in a barn. It was a good time to me and the people. Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i>
    was here, and tears of love and joy were running down his aged cheeks almost all the while. He was, like good old <i>Simeon</i>, ready to cry out, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    now lettest thy servant depart in peace.” At noon I preached at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>F――r</i>’s
    on the hill, to a glorious auditory indeed. Here <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    displayed his power, and caused much of his glory to pass before us. At four I preached again in a field near <i>Stroud</i>, where was a great congregation consisting of many, many thousands. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    helped and blessed me much here also. Afterwards I went to the new house at <i>Hampton</i>, and the glory of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    filled it. It is exceeding commodious for our purpose. I preached in the court-yard on <i>Monday</i> noon, to a large auditory. <i>Monday</i> evening the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gave me a good time at <i>Pitchcomb</i>. Both brother <i>C――</i> and brother <i>A――</i>’s society met at <i>Hampton</i>, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    met with us. Brother <i>C――</i> is certainly called of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    All call him a second <i>Bunyan</i>. I believe he must give himself wholly to the work. Such a hardy worker with his hands, and hearty preacher at the same time, I have scarce known. On <i>Tuesday</i> a man was hung in chains at <i>Hampton Common</i>.—A more miserable spectacle I have not seen. I preached in the morning to a great auditory about a mile off the place of execution. I intended doing the same after the criminal was turned off; but the weather was very violent.—Thousands and thousands came and staid to hear; but, through misinformation, kept on the top of the hill,
    <a id="p010"></a>while I preached in the bottom. After this I came to <i>Gloucester</i>, and preached in the evening in a barn: a night much to be remembered! This morning I preached again, and dined with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>E――d I――s</i>
    and some more at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>E――</i>’s.
    I am just going to my evening lecture, and to-morrow I shall leave <i>Gloucester</i> for a few days. The association is put off for a week, so I shall have more time in <i>Gloucestershire</i>. Never did I see people more hungry and simple. Many come telling me what the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    did for their souls when I was here last. To him be all the glory! Brother <i>A――</i> is now with me. He must be in the country ’till the house is more settled. I am sure <span
      class="smcap">God</span> called me here.</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Now sit down to fulfil my promise made to you last night.—I think in a former letter I gave you an account of what the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    had done for and by me since I left <i>London</i>, though indeed I cannot tell you the hundredth part. On <i>Tuesday</i> evening I preached at <i>Gloucester</i> with as convincing, soul-edifying power, as ever I felt in my life. The barn, though made more commodious, was and is generally quite crouded. On <i>Friday</i> morning I preached again; and afterwards went to <i>Hampton</i>; the snow falling and freezing on us all the way. In the evening I preached at <i>Chalford</i>, upon “walking with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>:”
    he was with me and the auditory. On <i>Saturday</i> I preached at <i>Ruscom</i> in the morning, and at <i>King-stanley</i> in the afternoon. In the evening, I visited brother <i>C――</i>’s gracious society; and afterwards rode to <i>Hampton</i>, which made about twenty miles. The congregations on account of the weather were not so great, but our Saviour most richly fed us. The word distilled like the dew; and at <i>Stanley</i> I think I was in the very suburbs of heaven. O free grace! On <i>Sunday</i> morning I preached at <i>Dursley</i>, about seven miles from <i>Hampton</i>, where our dear brother <i>A――</i> had been taken down the <i>Sunday</i> before; but no one was permitted to touch or molest us. The congregation consisted of some thousands, and the
    <a id="p011"></a>word came with a most gloriously convincing power. I came away rejoicing, and in the afternoon preached to about ten thousand on <i>Hampton</i> common, at what the people now call <i>Whitefield’s Tump</i>, because I preached there first. I cannot tell you what a solemn occasion that was. I perceive a great alteration in the people since I was in these parts last. They did indeed hang on me to hear the word. It ran and was glorified. In the evening, we had a most precious meeting with the two united societies in the new house at <i>Hampton</i>. Surely many thereabouts will walk with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Last night and this morning I preached again with great power; preaching in <i>Gloucestershire</i> is now like preaching at the tabernacle at <i>London</i>. This evening I am to preach again; and after that to hold our first love-feast.—What our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    does for us hereafter, you shall hear in my next. And now, my dear Sir, help me to be thankful, and bless the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>

    <span class="dropcap">M</span>Y soul is kept exceeding chearful; and greater and more continued freedom in preaching, I never experienced, than since I have been in <i>Gloucester</i> and <i>Gloucestershire</i>. On <i>Tuesday</i> evening we had a blessed love-feast. On <i>Wednesday</i> morning I preached here with great sweetness; and at noon at <i>Painswick</i>.—In the evening I preached at <abbr

    in the place where the <span

    met us remarkably one night about a twelvemonth ago. He met us again most delightfully, not in terror, but in love: by which I guessed how the gospel had gained ground in a twelvemonth’s time. After this I visited dear brother <i>C――</i>’s society, and then rode to <i>Hampton</i>, with brothers <i>A――</i> and <i>G――</i>, praising and blessing <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    On <i>Wednesday</i> noon I preached at <i>Quarhouse</i>, from the stump where old <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Cole</i>
    used to stand. It was an alarming time. My soul enjoyed exceeding great liberty. In the evening I preached in the new house at <i>Hampton</i> to
    <a id="p012"></a>many hundreds, and afterwards met the society. Yesterday morning I came hither. At noon and at night I preached in the barn; it was quite crouded.

    <i>My Dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">O</span>N <i>Monday</i> I received your letter of <i>April 2</i>; but till now, have had no opportunity of answering it. I preached and took my leave of the <i>Gloucester</i> people with mutual and great concern, on <i>Sunday</i> evening last. It was past one in the morning, before I could lay my weary body down.—At five I rose again, sick for want of rest; but I was enabled to get on horseback and ride to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>F――</i>’s,
    where I preached to a large congregation, who came there at seven in the morning, hoping to feel the power of a risen <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    They were not disappointed of their hope. At ten I read prayers, and preached from these words,—“I am the resurrection and the life,” and afterwards was helped to administer the sacrament in <i>Stonehouse</i> church. Then I rode to <i>Stroud</i>, where I was enabled to preach to about twelve thousand, with uncommon freedom and power, in Mrs. <i>G――</i>’s field. Much of the divine presence was there.—About six in the evening I preached to about the like number on <i>Hampton Common</i>; but scarce ever with a more pleasing convincing power. The order and solemnity wherewith the people broke up, was very instructive. After this I went to <i>Hampton</i>, and held a general love-feast with the united societies. My soul was kept close to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>;
    my bodily strength renewed; and I went to-bed about midnight, very chearful and very happy. The next morning I went and preached near <i>Dursley</i>, to some thousands, with great convictions accompanying the word. About seven I
    <a id="p013"></a>reached <i>Bristol</i>, and preached with wonderful power to a full congregation at <i>Smith’s Hall</i>; and afterwards spent the evening agreeably with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>
    of <i>Bath</i>, and some other dear friends. On <i>Tuesday</i> morning I preached again to a full congregation, and then set out for this place, where we came about eight in the evening, and had sweet and profitable conversation with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    and some others of the brethren. We sung an hymn, prayed, and parted in great harmony. On <i>Wednesday</i> about noon I opened the association with a close and solemn discourse upon walking with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. Indeed much of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was with us. The brethren and the people felt much of the divine presence. Afterwards we betook ourselves to business: several matters of great importance were dispatched. We broke up about seven, and met again about ten, and continued settling the affairs of the societies till about two in the morning. On <i>Thursday</i> we sat again till about four in the afternoon; then, after taking a little refreshment, and talking warmly of the things of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I preached with great freedom upon the believer’s rest, and then we went on with our business, and finished our association about midnight: all acknowledged that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    had been with us, and blessed him for the same. Perhaps in a month I may come to <i>London</i>; but it seems to be the will of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    I should stay in <i>Wales</i> about a fortnight, and take a tour into <i>Pembrokeshire</i>. Great doors are open there. Our Saviour keeps me very happy indeed; and is, I believe, preparing greater blessings, for</p>

    was much with me, and I hope much good work was done. Several sent for me to their houses. Dear brother <i>H――</i> exhorts in every place.

One of the ministers preached much against me last <i>Sunday</i>, and mentioned me by name; but, like my other opposers (and like the viper biting the file) he only hurt himself. I am as it were in a new, but very unthought of pleasant world. O how many thousands within these few days have heard the word! I thought to see you next week; but as I am here, perhaps it may be best to go round now, and so be at <i>London</i> at Pentecost. In about a fortnight, therefore, you may expect to see me.</p>

    These words have much refreshed me, “And the <span

    was with <i>David</i>, whithersoever he went.” After I wrote my last from a gentlewoman’s near the <i>Hay</i>, I went towards <i>Builth</i>, and got into my lodgings about one, and into my bed about two o’clock in the morning. The next day I preached at <i>Builth</i>, with much of the Redeemer’s presence. Then I rode to the <i>Gore</i>, the last place I preached at in <i>Wales</i>; and indeed our Saviour kept the good wine ’till last: he made our cup to overflow.—Between eight and nine at night we set out for <i>Leominster</i>, and reached there between two and three in the morning. At eleven, and three, I preached. It was quite fallow ground. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    broke it up, and gave me a blessed entrance into <i>Herefordshire</i>. All glory be to his great Name! The same night I lay at <i>Hereford</i>. Even there some of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    disciples were to be found, as also at <i>Ross</i>, where we baited yesterday. In both places I might have preached, would time have permitted; but I was hastening to <i>Gloucester</i>, where the good Shepherd of <i>Israel</i> brought us in peace and safety about eight in the evening; after having in about three weeks travelled about four hundred <i>English</i> miles, spent three days in attending two associations, preached about forty times, visited about thirteen towns, and passed through seven counties. Here then will I set up my <i>Ebenezer</i>, thank the adorable <span

    for these and all other his mercies, and from the bottom of my heart give him all the glory. I know my dearest friend will join with me, and say a hearty Amen. “Even so, <span

    hath opened fresh doors for you, my dear brother. The rams horns are sounding about <i>Jericho</i>; surely the towering walls will at length fall down. But we must have patience.

Our divisions in <i>England</i> have the worst aspect, while they are now united in <i>Wales</i>: but even this shall work for good, and cause the Redeemer’s glory to shine more conspicuous. This is my comfort; “The government is upon his shoulders,” and he is a “wonderful counsellor.”</p>

I am but just returned from a circuit of 400 miles in <i>Gloucestershire</i> and <i>South Wales</i>. <i>Dagon</i> hath every where fallen before the ark, and the fields are white ready unto harvest. The congregations were very large, and I was never enabled to preach with greater power. I purpose staying here about a month, and once more to attack the prince of darkness in <i>Moor-fields</i>, when the holidays come. Many precious souls have been captivated with <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    love in that wicked place. <i>Jerusalem</i> sinners bring most glory to the Redeemer. Where I shall go next, I cannot yet tell. If my Master should point out the way, a visit to <i>Yorkshire</i> would be very
    <a id="p021"></a>agreeable. Perhaps <i>Exeter</i> and <i>Cornwall</i> may be the next places. That is dry ground. I love to range in such places. O my dear brother, continue to pray for me, and help me to praise the blessed Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.

  <p>
    <i>My very dear faithful Friend and Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER watching, and praying, and striving some days for direction and assistance, I now sit down to write you a letter; though I know not well what to say or do. The concern I have felt for you, and my dear family, has had an effect on my body, and increased that weakness, which the season of the year, my constant labours, and continual care upon various accounts, have brought upon me. In the midst of all, my soul I trust grows, and is kept happy in the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    His strength is daily made perfect in my weakness, and I am made more than conqueror through his love. I am somewhat concerned, that scarce any of my letters have reached your hands. I was glad, however, to find, that you had received one dated in <i>May</i> last. Since that, I hope you have received more. I rejoice that our loving Saviour has not permitted you to want. You are his family, and he would not detain me from you, had not he determined to provide for you in my absence. I fear I have been sinfully impatient to come over. I think, I could be sold a slave to serve at the gallies, rather than you and my dear Orphan-family should want. Sometimes my wicked heart has said, “if I know I should have staid so long, I would not have come over to <i>England</i> at all.” But <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    thoughts are not as our thoughts. It is best to be kept at his feet, waiting to know what he would have us to do. By and by we shall know all;
    <a id="p022"></a>’till then, let us wait patiently; against hope may we believe in hope, and being strong in faith give glory to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. After I have fought the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    battles in <i>Moor-fields</i> these holidays, I think to take a tour into <i>Cornwall</i> and <i>Wales</i>, and perhaps, to <i>Ireland</i>. I have sometimes thought I am detained on purpose to go there. I wonder not at your silence. You may well expect me; but I must not mention it, lest my impatient heart should again say, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    why wilt thou not let me go?” My first fellow-traveller, scarce a day passes without my speaking of, and often praying for you. Old love has revived long since in my soul. I am persuaded, our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will reward you even in this life, for your fidelity to unworthy me. “Be strong in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    and in the power of his might.” While I am writing the fire kindles, and I almost forget my bodily weakness. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    be with you. I hear the <i>Spaniards</i> intend a second invasion; but those words still follow and comfort me, “The enemies which you have seen, you shall see no more for ever.” You are the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    family; he will take care of you; fear them not. I have many things to impart, when I see you face to face. ’Till then the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    be with your spirit, and grant that you and yours may increase with all the increase of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    In bonds of an eternal friendship, with greater affection than words can well express, I subscribe myself,</p>

    <i>My very dear Brother B――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">L</span>ITTLE did I think, when I parted from you at <i>Bethesda</i>, that I should be writing to you at this time in <i>London</i>. But <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    ways are in the great waters, and his footsteps are not known. I have essayed to come to you more than once, or twice; but I believe I can say, “the spirit suffered me not.” In thought I am with you daily; when I shall come in person, our Saviour only knows: perhaps, at an hour which neither you nor I think of. You will see what I have wrote
    <a id="p023"></a>(though in much weakness) to my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>.
    The present weakness of my body will not suffer me to enlarge much to you; though, was I to follow the inclination of my soul, I should fill up many sheets. My dear brother, I love you unfeignedly in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and heartily thank you for all your works of faith, and the care you have taken of my dear family. Surely our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    sent you to <i>Bethesda</i>, and however cloudy the prospect may have been for some time, I am persuaded a glorious sunshine will succeed, and you shall yet see the salvation of our <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. When our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has any thing great to do, he is generally a great while bringing it about, and many unaccountable dark providences generally intervene. Thus it was with <i>Abraham</i>, <i>Jacob</i>, <i>Joseph</i>, <i>Moses</i>, and all the eminent men of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in the days of old. Thus our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is pleased to deal with me, and my affairs. Many precious promises have been given me in respect to myself, my dear family, and the church of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    which I am sure will be fulfilled in due time. I long to be with you, to open our hearts freely, and to tell one another what our good <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has done for our souls. Great things has he done for me indeed, and greater things is he yet doing, and about to do. The work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is likely to spread far and near, and such are daily added to the church as shall be saved. I am employed every moment for the best of Masters, and only lament that I can do no more. For some days, my body has been much indisposed, but not so as to prevent my preaching. As my day is, so is my strength; and as afflictions abound, consolations much more abound. I know that this will lead you to give thanks on my behalf. I am glad when I hear it goes well with you and yours. I am now like <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>,
    who could have no rest, ’till he sent a brother to the church, that he might enquire of their affairs, and know how they did. The person that brings this, loves <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    in sincerity, and I trust will be a blessing to the house. I would have him employed among the children, or as you and the brethren shall think fit. Our Saviour, I hope, will direct you in every thing. As strength shall permit, I intend writing to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>J――</i>. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for raising up such dear friends. He never can or will forsake those that put their trust in him. I hope it is well with you and yours. I doubt not but your souls
    <a id="p024"></a>prosper. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>

      title="thirteenth">13th</abbr>,
    wherein he acquainted me of the welfare of the dear family, and of another out-pouring of the spirit among you. O! my soul does magnify the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>, and my spirit rejoices in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    my Saviour. After this, I expect to hear of another shock: but I know you are the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s,
    and he will take care of your souls. As <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>E――</i>
    is going on board, I have not time to say half I would. I fear I am sinfully impatient to see you. The time will come by and by. Hasten it, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    if it be thy blessed will! Our Saviour does greater things for me every day. Last <i>Sunday</i> morning, I collected 23<abbr
      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
    for the orphans in <i>Moor-fields</i>. It would amaze you to see the great congregations, and wonderful presence of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    Grace! grace! I have paid all that is due in <i>England</i>, and have sent you 25<abbr
      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> by the bearer. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I shall remit you more soon. Pray give my humble respects to dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>J――</i>,
    and tell him, our Saviour will enable me to pay him all soon with a thousand thanks. I sent you 100<abbr
      title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>
    by my brother’s ship, and a packet of letters. I hope they came safe to hand. But I must have done. Salute my dear family, and believe me to be, though now in great haste, dear man,</p>

    and him crucified. This I think is the only way to propagate the gospel of the grace of <span

    Our Saviour blesses me in it much, and owns and strengthens me more and more. I have been very weak in body, but every day my strength hath been renewed, and I have been enabled to mount on wings like an eagle. God willing, I shall leave <i>London</i> on <i>Monday</i> next. If I should be out of town, you will be kindly received. Glory be to <span

    was with us of a truth. We dined very comfortably, and then set out for <i>Gloucester</i>, shouting, Grace! grace! When I arrived, our Saviour was exceeding gracious; and I had so much of heaven in my soul, that I wanted to lie down any where to praise my <span

    I preached here early the next morning, then rode to <i>Cheltenham</i>, and returned hither in the afternoon, and preached in the evening.

    <i>Gloucester, June 21, 1743.</i></p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">O</span>N <i>Saturday</i> I answered your two last letters. Our Saviour sent me to <i>Gloucester</i> for wise ends. Much substantial good has been done to several of the society. My mouth
    <a id="p027"></a>and heart were greatly opened in preaching. <i>Saturday</i> evening was a time much to be remembered. <i>Sunday</i>, was a great day of the Son of Man. I preached at <i>Gloucester</i> in the morning, and near <i>Stroud</i> in the evening. The word was clothed with much power, both for sinners and saints. I think the congregation at <i>Hampton</i> was rather greater than ever. At night we had a precious meeting in <i>Hampton-house</i> garden; the house itself being too small to hold the people without almost stifling them. The simplicity, sweetness, and broken-heartedness of the poor souls would have melted your heart. Indeed, much grace was upon them, and many, I believe, to their unspeakable consolation, heard the voice of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord God</span>
    in the trees of the garden in the cool of the day. On <i>Monday</i> morning I preached again, and came away rejoicing. Whilst I was at <i>Hampton</i>, <i>J. C――</i> told me, how he and the people had been abused. My coming at this time, I believe, has much strengthened the persecuted. Indeed there is a glorious work in <i>Gloucestershire</i>. Brother <i>C――</i> is truly a great soul! one of the weak things that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has chosen to confound the strong. In my journey from <i>Hampton</i> hither, our dear Master was graciously with us. We have blessed news from <i>Scotland</i>. Brave news also from <i>Pembrokeshire</i>. Surely the kingdom of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> and his <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is coming on apace. I know you say, “Come, <span

    <i>P. S.</i> I must acquaint you, by way of postscript, of the following anecdote of the old <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Cole</i>,
    a most venerable dissenting minister; whom I was always taught to ridicule, and (with shame I write it) used, when a boy, to run into his meeting-house, and cry, <i>Old Cole! old Cole! old Cole!</i> Being asked once by one of his congregation, what business I would be of? I said, “a minister, but I would take care never to tell stories in the pulpit, like the old <i>Cole</i>.” About twelve years afterwards, the old man heard me preach in one of the churches at <i>Gloucester</i>; and on my telling some story to illustrate the subject I was upon, having been informed what I had before said, made this remark to one of his elders, “I find that young <i>Whitefield</i> can now tell stories, as well as old <i>Cole</i>.” Being affected
    <a id="p028"></a>much with my preaching, he was as it were become young again, and used to say, when coming to and returning from <i>Barn</i>, “These are days of the Son of Man indeed!” nay, he was so animated, and so humbled, that he used to subscribe himself <i>my Curate</i>, and went about preaching after me in the country, from place to place. But one evening, whilst preaching, he was struck with death, and then asked for a chair to lean on ’till he concluded his sermon, when he was carried up stairs and died. O blessed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    if it be thy holy will, may my exit be like his!</p>

    <span class="dropcap">F</span>ULL of divine consolations, and at the same time, I trust, deeply sensible of my own vileness, I have just arose from the throne of grace, where I have been laying yours, my own, and the affairs of the whole church, before our common Father and our <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    He was pleased to give me sweet access, and to assure me, that if he gave me his presence, he would freely give me all things; but I must wait his time and season, because that will be better for me. I have therefore just now put my soul, as a blank, into the hands of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    my Redeemer, and desired him to write upon it what he pleases. I know it will be his own image. Methinks I hear you say, Amen. I know you do from your heart; for I believe you love me in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, as I do you, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    knoweth. Our Saviour, by his wise providence has prevented our receiving each others letters so soon as we expected. I preached <i>Tuesday</i> last in the evening at <i>Bristol</i>, and on <i>Wednesday</i> twice; and once at <i>Kingswood</i>.—On <i>Thursday</i> in the morning I preached there also, and afterwards went to <i>Bath</i>, where I was most cordially received by <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>, and one <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>,
    a christian physician, and Lady <i>C――</i>. Here our Saviour gave me fresh hints, that if I would stand still and wait his time and way, he would make even my enemies to be at peace with me. I returned in the evening to <i>Bristol</i>, and preached. I think it was this day the news came of his Majesty’s fighting, and coming off conqueror. I had observed for
    <a id="p029"></a>some time past, when praying for him, whether I would or not, out came this petition, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    cover thou his head in the day of battle.” Tho’ even while I was praying, I wondered why I prayed so, not knowing that he was gone to <i>Germany</i> to fight. This gave me fresh confidence towards <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I spent almost the whole day on <i>Friday</i> in retirement, and prayer. My house was made a Bethel to me indeed, the very gate of heaven. <i>Saturday</i> I preached again, and found in the day-time our Saviour had blessed my endeavours to some souls. About three in the afternoon we set out for <i>Wiltshire</i>. On <i>Sunday</i> I preached at <i>Brinkworth</i>, on these words: “Thy Maker is thy husband.” It was a day of espousals I believe to many. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was with us of a truth. After sermon, I rode to <i>Longley</i>, in company with many dear children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who attended me both on horseback and on foot. We sung, and looked like persons that had been at a spiritual wedding. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    helped me in preaching there also. All was quiet. In the evening I preached at <i>Tetherton</i>, and a blessed time it was. We rode like as the children of <i>Israel</i> passing through the enemies country. Afterwards we set out for <i>Hampton</i>, and reached there about midnight. After having travelled about thirty miles, I yet preached thrice. This morning I arose like a giant refreshed with wine, and came hither about eleven. I found my mother recovered from her illness, and my own soul filled and blessed in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    O grace! how sweet is it? I am glad you are thirsting after an abiding in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    after greater degrees of knowledge, both of yourself, and of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    whom to know is life eternal. In order to this, you must expect many trials, and well it is to be under the discipline of so tender a Master. I know you will pray to the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    to make and keep me humble. I recommend you to his care, and wish you all the blessings of the everlasting covenant, from</p>

Words cannot express how good our blessed Saviour has been to me, since I wrote last. I preached there on <i>Monday</i> night, and <i>Tuesday</i> morning. The <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of love filled my soul, and enabled me to speak of his love with great power. Many felt it also. On <i>Tuesday</i> after morning sermon I went to <i>Abergavenny</i>; <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    was with me on the road; and we reached there about ten at night. On <i>Wednesday</i> I went to <i>Trevecka</i>, where I met with a whole troop of <span
      class="smcap">Jesu</span>’s
    witnesses. I had some hours by myself, and shed many tears of love before the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    At five in the evening, I preached to a larger congregation than ever I had seen at <i>Trevecka</i>. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    was with us of a truth, and I felt the power of that blood upon my own soul, which I was recommending to others. After I had done, brother <i>H――l D――</i> and <i>R――</i> preached and prayed. The holy spirit came down, especially when the latter preached, in a plentiful manner.—About eight we opened the association with great solemnity. Our Saviour was much with me, teaching and helping me to fill my place in a particular manner. The brethren felt the same. About midnight we adjourned; but several of the brethren sat up all night, and ushered in the morning with prayer and praise. About eight we met again, and were greatly delighted at the different and simple accounts the superintendents brought in of their respective societies. Some of their accounts were very particular, as to the state of the people’s souls; and several had gone off most triumphantly to glory. We continued doing business ’till two in the afternoon, and broke up with much solemnity and holy joy. Our Saviour kept the new-wine ’till last, and gave us a sweet parting blessing. We had great union with one another. Indeed, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    has done great things for <i>Wales</i>. The work is much upon the advance. I was surprized to find so much order. Brother <i>H―― D――</i> has been blessed to the conversion of a young clergyman, Rector of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>B――</i>,
    <i>London</i>. About five in
    <a id="p031"></a>the evening I returned to <i>Abergavenny</i>, and preached there on <i>Friday</i> morning, and afterwards set out for <i>Bristol</i>, where we arrived about eight in the evening. My house, friends, <abbr

This young confessor, some few years ago came out of curiosity to hear me, when first I preached upon <i>Hampton Common</i>, in <i>Gloucestershire</i>. Being converted himself, he found himself impelled to strengthen his brethren. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>

      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is and will be with me. The mob has breathed out many threatenings against me; but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is greater than all, and I am persuaded he’ll let them find him so. I rode all down the town without the least molestation, only many cried, (but silently as it were) “O, he is come home!” which was a surprizing thing to them; for a gentleman had affirmed, that he saw me in prison. I have been walking up the town, without any disturbance; but the
    <a id="p032"></a>mob, they say, continue more and more exasperated. We expect them soon. They generally apprize one another, by ringing a bell. The whole mob consist of about an hundred: but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    keeps me without the least fear, and at the same time gives me quietly to wait on him for direction, how to act. A few of the dear disciples are by me. We have been praying together, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is with us. I believe death in its ugliest shapes would not be terrible to some here, at least I think so of myself; and when I look to the faithfulness of my Saviour, I can loudly say, “As my day is, so my strength shall be.” Many of the people of the town have been with me, to tell me the respect they have for me, and how much they are concerned for the abuse that has been given us. I believe all will be well by and by. At the same time, I believe your coming might be much blessed to that end. I must conclude; but I think to give you a farther account on <i>Monday</i>, if our Saviour pleases. In the mean time, I heartily beg an interest in your prayers, and the whole society with you. Tell them, O tell them, to get ready for suffering, by cleaving close to the Lamb, rooted and grounded in him: withal please to give my kind love and service to them for <span

They came into the society and sat down, while I exhorted them to stedfastness and patience under the cross. They seemed much strengthened, and ready for any suffering; for <span

    promises to his church; though we are but a little branch. I had not prayed long, but many of us were persuaded, he would never leave or forsake us. In every prayer we asked direction how to act. I was persuaded, the only way to still the mob, was, not to resist or fly from them, but to give myself up wholly to them, and let them do all that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    should permit: for the more we had drawn back, the more our adversaries rejoiced, and vowed they would and should put an end to preaching in <i>Hampton</i>. The mob, which consisted of near an hundred, were now about the house, making a terrible noise, and swearing prodigiously. I went down to them and opened the door, and asking them what they wanted. I told them, if they wanted my life, I was willing to deliver it up for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>’s
    sake; but withal I desired to know, why they either disturbed me or sought my life? For I did not know I had given them any just cause for either. Some of them said, I had, by bringing in false doctrine, and impoverishing the poor. I told them, that they could prove neither, and that it was really false. They seemed something at a stand; when about five of them begun to be more exasperated, and took me, in order to throw me into a lime pit. I told them, they need not force me, for I was willing to suffer, though unjustly, for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>’s
    sake. But while they were pushing me along, some neighbours took me in their arms and carried me into one of their houses; so I was delivered out of their hands. On sabbath-day morning about twenty of the society met again. We spent the morning in prayer. In the evening I preached, and had uncommon strength and courage given
    <a id="p034"></a>me from the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    so that death in its ugliest shapes did not at all terrify me. About five in the afternoon we met in my house. I first exhorted them to keep their minds close to the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    and if the mob came, not at all to resist, but to make way for them to come to me, and let them do what the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    would permit. I then prayed and sung that hymn, “<i>Our lives, our blood, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr></i>”
    When we had so done, in came the mob, demanding me to come down. I asked, by what authority they did so? They swore they would have me. Then said I, so you shall. So they took me to the lime pit, and threw me in. But O what a power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    fell on my soul! I thought, with <i>Stephen</i>, the heavens opened to my sight, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    was ready, if I had died, to receive me. I believe my undaunted courage shook some. I told them, I should meet them at the judgment, and then their faces would gather paleness. They let me out, and I came home and kneeled down with the people that were there, and prayed to, and praised <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    After that, I exhorted from the three first verses of the third chapter of the first epistle of <i>John</i>. And when I was just concluding, in came the mob again, and took me to a brook to throw me in there. One, who was a persecutor but a few days before, endeavoured to hinder them; but they took me away, and led me all up the town. I had a sweet walk, and talked and reasoned with the persecutors all the way. My heart was full of love. Before I had gone far, all but one agreed to let me go back again, but he insisted upon my going. I told them, the law was open against them, nevertheless I was willing to suffer any thing for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Then they told me, if I would forbear preaching but for a month, they would let me go; I told them, I would make no such promise. So forward I went. One of them threw me in, and I went to the bottom, but I came up again, with my hands clasped together. I did not desire to come out, till they fetched me. Accordingly, in jumped one or two of them and took me out; but then one maliciously and cowardly pushed me in again, and much bruised and cut one of my legs against a stone. Some of the others were going to throw him in for so doing. I came home talking to them. Many seemed to repent of what they had done, and promised to molest me no more. I believe,
    <a id="p035"></a><span class="smcap">God</span> has smote some of their consciences. One who was the chief, and would not agree that I should go back, I hear by several, he says he will in no wise touch me again. Many advise us to prosecute them; but if they are quiet, I am content, and can say from my heart, “Father, forgive them.” I should be glad if you would be here next <i>Sunday</i>. In the mean time pray for me, who am,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have been so employed for some time past in preaching and travelling, that I could not possibly correspond with you or others as usual; but you see where I am; I came here to preach at the fair; because people from all parts flock hither at that season.

  <p>
    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">O</span>N <i>Thursday</i> I came here, and expected to be attacked; because I had heard, that the mob which had been so outragious towards you and others for so long time, had now threatened, that if ever I came there again, they would have a piece of my black gown to make aprons with. No sooner
    <a id="p036"></a>had I entered the town, but I saw and heard the signals, such as blowing of horns, and ringing of bells for gathering the mob. My soul was kept quite easy. I preached in a large grass plat from these words, “And seeing the grace of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    he exhorted them with full purpose of heart to cleave unto the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>;”
    and as it happened, I finished my sermon and pronounced the blessing, just as the ring-leader of the mob broke in upon us, which I soon perceived disappointed and grieved them very much. One of them, as I was coming down from the table, called me <i>coward</i>; but I told him, they should hear from me another way. I then went into the house, and preached upon the stair case to a large number of serious souls; but these real troublers of <i>Israel</i> soon came in to mock and mob us. But feeling what I never felt before, as you know I have very little natural courage, strength and power being given us from above, I leaped down stairs, and all ran away before me. However they continued making a noise about the house till midnight, abusing the poor people as they went home, and as we hear they broke one young lady’s arm in two places. Brother <i>A――</i> they threw a second time into the pool, in which operation he received a deep wound in his leg. <i>John C――</i>’s life, that second <i>Bunyan</i>, was much threatened.—Young <i>W―― H――</i> they wheeled in a barrow to the pool’s side, lamed his brother, and grievously hurt several others. Hearing that two or three clergymen were in the town, one of whom was a justice of the peace, I went to them; but alas! I seemed unto them as one that mocked, and instead of redressing, they laid the cause of all the grievances at my door; but, by the help of my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I shall still persist in preaching myself, and in encouraging those (as I know no law of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    or man against it) who I believe are truly moved by the Holy Ghost. As I came out from the clergymen, two of the unhappy mobbers were particularly insolent, and huzza’d us out of town. “Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad,” for now I humbly hope, I begin to be a disciple of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>;
    since to suffer for, as well as to believe and preach his precious truths, and own his despis’d people, is now given to,</p>

    soon made way for himself into the people’s hearts. Yesterday

    to acquaint you, that in our last association we agreed not to separate from the established church, but go on in our usual way. Indeed, the motion to separate, was only made by a very few of more contracted principles.

    has affixed his seal for many years past, and

    <i>Dear Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span> Thousand thanks for your kind solicitude concerning me and mine. My wife has been in trying circumstances, partly through the unskilfulness of a chaise-driver, I mean myself. Being advised to take her out into the air, I drove her as well as myself, through in advertence, into a ditch. Finding that we were falling, she put her hand cross the chaise, and thereby preserved us both from being thrown out. The ditch might be about 14 feet deep, but blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    though all that saw us falling, cried out, they are killed, yet, through infinite mercy, we received no great hurt. The place was very narrow near the bottom, and yet the horse went down, as tho’ let down by a pulley. A stander-by ran down and catched hold of its head, to prevent its going forwards. I got upon its back and was drawn out by a long whip; whilst my wife hanging between the chaise and the bank, was pulled up on the other side by two or three kind assistants. Being both in a comfortable frame, I must own, to my shame, that I felt rather regret than thankfulness in escaping what I thought would be a kind of a translation, to our wished-for haven. But O amazing love! we were so strengthened, that the chaise and horse being taken up, and our bruises being washed with vinegar in a neighbouring house, we went on our intended way, and came home rejoicing in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    our Saviour. Not expecting my wife’s delivery

    instant, at <i>Avon</i>. In the morning I walked to <i>Tetherton</i>, and preached there with much of the divine presence, and to the abundant satisfaction and comfort of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    people. After sermon, I baptized four boys, each about three months old, as near as I can remember. The ordinance was so solemn and awful that <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>G――</i>
    (who you know is a quaker) had a mind immediately to partake of it. When I go to <i>Wiltshire</i>, I believe I shall baptize her and her children, with some adult persons that have tasted of redeeming love. About one o’clock I preached at <i>Clack</i> in the street. All was quiet. I then rode to <i>Brinkworth</i>, and was enabled to preach there with still greater freedom, and afterwards administred the Holy Sacrament to about two hundred and fifty communicants. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    made himself known to many in breaking of bread. Some strangers, that came from <i>Bath</i>, went home filled with our Redeemer’s presence. I have preached at <i>Chippenham</i>. I hope I managed all things right about the affair of the <i>Hampton</i> rioters. It seems, they have compelled us to appeal unto <i>Cæsar</i>. Evidences shall be examined in the country, time enough to send their examinations up to town. We had a wonderful time in <i>Wiltshire</i>. On <i>Saturday</i> last, when I came to <i>Wellington</i>, the Reverend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>D――</i>
    persuaded me to stay there, because the country people had come from all quarters several times to hear me, and had been disappointed. I consented, and preached in his meeting-house in the evening to a large auditory. The Reverend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>F――t</i>,
    formerly pupil to doctor <i>D――</i>, came there, and staid all night. The blessed <span

    gave us much freedom in conversation. I hope both will be instruments under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in promoting a good work in these parts. <i>Sunday</i> morning I preached again in the meeting-house, and in the evening to seven thousand in the fields. On <i>Monday</i> about ten in the morning, and in the afternoon about two, I preached at <i>Cullompton</i> with much freedom and power; was kindly received, met some reputable dissenters, and am now setting out for

I find there is a needs-be for all; for by our being acquainted with the enemy’s work in our own hearts, we see how he works on others, and are enabled to speak better to their hearts. “Whether we are afflicted (says the apostle,) or whether we are comforted, it is for your sake.” Besides, by temptation we are kept from sinking into formality, and consequently are taught better to handle our spiritual weapons, and discover what is amiss both in heart and life. For this cause, we are commanded to rejoice when we fall into divers temptations. I thank <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for giving you some experience of these things. We must now all be <i>Calebs</i>; all heart, but at the same time, all humility. Feeling we can do nothing of ourselves, yet believing we can do all things through <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    strengthening us. Blessed be his Name, the common people begin to feel. I preached between two and three this afternoon on <i>Southern-hay</i>, and expounded in the evening at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>K――</i>’s.
    Even some of the polite were much affected last night; and this morning, O what a blessed season had we! I believe I shall think it my duty to stay in these parts for some time. Continue to pray for me, and assure yourself that you are never forgotten by</p>

On <i>Monday</i> last I went to <i>Axminster</i>, and preached to about two thousand without, and afterward exhorted within the house, where I lay. The next day I preached to a greater number of people, and with more freedom. I gave an exhortation at night, and met the society. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    vouchsafed us a gracious blessing. On <i>Wednesday</i> I went to <i>Ottery</i>, but just as I named my text, the bells rang. Upon this I adjourned to a field, whither the people ran in droves.—As I stepped into the inn, before I went into the field, a clergyman came, who asked me by what authority I preached, said it was a riot, and that the meeting was illegal. I answered him as I thought pertinently, and afterwards went and shewed him my authority, by preaching on these words: “Go ye to all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” Between six and seven in the evening, I returned to <i>Exeter</i>, where some hundreds were waiting to hear me expound. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> was with us. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    makes this place very comfortable to me. Prejudices fall off daily, and people begin not only rationally to discern, but powerfully to feel the doctrines of the gospel. To-morrow, <span

    He lately preached three times and rode forty miles the same day. The dissenting minister and his wife were very hearty, and perhaps here is one of the most settled female christian societies in the kingdom. I cannot well describe with what power the word was attended. Yesterday in the afternoon, and in the evening, it was just like as at <i>Edinburgh</i>. The old clergyman was much broken. A young <i>Oxonian</i>, who came with him, and many others, were most deeply affected. I suppose there were upwards of two thousand in the evening in the Meeting-house. Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――y</i>,
    one of our first Methodists at <i>Oxford</i>, and who was lately a curate here, had laid the blessed foundation. So far therefore from thinking of nestling at <i>London</i>, that I am more and more convinced that I should go from place to place, and therefore question if I shall see <i>London</i> for some time.

    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">W</span>HAT do you think? Since my last, I have stole a whole day to dispatch some private business: however, in the evening I expounded to a great room full of people, who would rush into my lodgings, whether I would or not. On <i>Sunday</i> morning at eight I preached in the street to about a thousand, with much freedom. I then went to church and received the sacrament, and afterwards preached to several thousands in the street. The hearers seemed much pleased and delighted. It happened by the providence of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that no minister would come to preach at a house at <i>Wedgbury</i>, where a weekly lecture used to be kept up: I was therefore earnestly entreated to come. I went, after my afternoon’s
    <a id="p047"></a>preaching at <i>Birmingham</i>, and preached there at six in the evening to many hundreds in the street. It is about six miles from <i>Birmingham</i>. The word came with power, and only one or two made a noise at a distance. Afterwards we had a precious meeting in private. The power of the dear Redeemer was much amongst us. The person with whom I lodged was a widow fearing <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Her husband was an eminent saint, and had been refreshed by my writings, particularly my journals, as had many others that I met with. On <i>Monday</i> morning about eight I preached to a large company in a field. By eleven I returned to <i>Birmingham</i>, and preached to many thousands on a Common near the town. The soldiers were exercising; but the officers hearing that I was coming to preach, dismissed them, and promised that no disturbance should be made. All was quiet, and a blessed time we had. In the afternoon about three I preached again to about the same company, with the same success. Then I rode to <i>Wedgbury</i> and preached there, and afterwards exhorted: but I cannot well tell you, what a sweet melting time there was. Many were in tears. About one I went to bed exceeding happy. In the morning I broke up some fallow ground at a place called <i>Mare-Green</i>, about two miles from <i>Wedgbury</i>. Much mobbing had been there against <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Wesley</i>’s
    friends. A few poor souls began to insult me, but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    strengthened me much. Several clods were thrown, one of them fell on my head, and another struck my fingers, while I was in prayer. A sweet gospel spirit was given to me. I preached again at <i>Birmingham</i> to larger auditories than before, about eleven the same morning and three in the afternoon. In the evening I expounded twice in a large room. Once to the rich, and once to the poor, and went to rest happier than the night before. In the morning I took my leave of the <i>Birmingham</i> people, who wept much and were indeed deeply affected, and shewed great concern at my departure. I then went to <i>Kidderminster</i>, about twelve miles from <i>Birmingham</i>, where I was kindly received by <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――ms</i>,
    with whom I have corresponded for near two years. Many friends were at his house. I was greatly refreshed to find what a sweet savour of good <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Baxter</i>’s
    doctrine, works and discipline remained to this day.</p>

  <p class="in_00 quobrk">
    I preached about three in the afternoon to a large auditory near the church. Some unkind men, though they promised not to do so, rang the bells; but our Saviour enabled me to preach with power. In the evening and next morning I preached in the meeting house. I then went with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    to <i>Bromsgrove</i>, about seven miles from <i>Kidderminster</i>, and was kindly received by one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>K――y</i>,
    a good man, and several others, among whom were two or three Baptist and one Independent ministers. About three in the afternoon I preached in a field. Some rude people kicked a football and sounded a horn at some distance, but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    enabled me to preach with boldness. About six I preached in the Baptist Meeting-house, left <i>Kidderminster</i> at eight, and reached <i>Worcester</i> about ten at night. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――ms</i>
    and another friend accompanied us. In the morning the good old <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――y</i>,
    who was supposed to be sanctified from the womb, came to us while we baited. In the evening I reached <i>Gloucester</i>, very thankful for my week’s progress, and rejoicing greatly in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    for giving me such a delightful and happy Christmas. This day I have preached twice here, and have been enabled to dispatch some private affairs. It is now near twelve. My dear friend, I wish you an exceeding happy new year. This time twelve-month I was writing to you from <i>Bristol</i>. O what has the dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    done for me since that, and since I was born! And O what does he intend to do for me before I die, and when time shall be no more? I am lost in wonder! I must away and cry Grace! grace! Praying that you may be filled with all the fulness of <span

    <i>Gloucester, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 9, 1744.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">W</span>HO knows what a day may bring forth? Last night I was called to sacrifice my <i>Isaac</i>; I mean to bury
    <a id="p051"></a>my only child and son about four months old. Many things occurred to make me believe he was not only to be continued to me, but to be a preacher of the everlasting gospel. Pleased with the thought, and ambitious of having a son of my own, so divinely employed, satan was permitted to give me some wrong impressions, whereby, as I now find, I misapplied several texts of scripture. Upon these grounds I made no scruple of declaring, “that I should have a son, and that his name was to be <i>John</i>.” I mentioned the very time of his birth, and fondly hoped, that he was to be great in the sight of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    Every thing happened according to the predictions, and my wife having had several narrow escapes while pregnant, especially by her falling from a high horse, and my driving her into a deep ditch in a one-horse chaise a little before the time of her lying-in, and from which we received little or no hurt, confirmed me in my expectation, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    would grant me my heart’s desire. I would observe to you, that the child was even born in a room, which the master of the house had prepared as a prison for his wife for coming to hear me. With joy would she often look upon the bars and staples and chains which were fixed in order to keep her in. About a week after his birth, I publickly baptized him in the Tabernacle, and in the company of thousands solemnly gave him up to that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who gave him to me. A hymn, too fondly composed by an aged widow, as suitable to the occasion, was sung, and all went away big with hopes of the child’s being hereafter to be employed in the work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    but how soon are all their fond, and as the event hath proved, their ill-grounded expectations blasted, as well as mine. House-keeping being expensive in <i>London</i>, I thought best to send both parent and child to <i>Abergavenny</i>, where my wife had a little house of my own, the furniture of which, as I thought of soon embarking for <i>Georgia</i>, I had partly sold, and partly given away. In their journey thither, they stopped at <i>Gloucester</i> at the <i>Bell-Inn</i>, which my brother now keeps, and in which I was born. There, my beloved was cut off with a stroke. Upon my coming here, without knowing what had happened, I enquired concerning the welfare of parent and child; and by the answer, found that the flower was cut down. I immediately called all to join in prayer, in which I blessed the Father of mercies for giving me
    <a id="p052"></a>a son, continuing it to me so long, and taking it from me so soon. All joined in desiring that I would decline preaching ’till the child was buried; but I remembered a saying of good <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Henry</i>,
    “that weeping must not hinder sowing,” and therefore preached twice the next day, and also the day following; on the evening of which, just as I was closing my sermon, the bell struck out for the funeral. At first, I must acknowledge, it gave nature a little shake, but looking up I recovered strength, and then concluded with saying, that this text on which I had been preaching, namely, “all things worked together for good to them that love <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,”
    made me as willing to go out to my son’s funeral, as to hear of his birth. Our parting from him was solemn. We kneeled down, prayed, and shed many tears, but I hope tears of resignation: And then, as he died in the house wherein I was born, he was taken and laid in the church where I was baptized, first communicated, and first preached. All this you may easily guess threw me into very solemn and deep reflection, and I hope deep humiliation; but I was comforted from that passage in the book of Kings, where is recorded the death of the <i>Shunamite</i>’s child, which the Prophet said, “The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    had hid from him;” and the woman’s answer likewise to the Prophet when he asked, “Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with thy child?” And she answered, “<i>It is well.</i>” This gave me no small satisfaction. I immediately preached upon the text the day following at <i>Gloucester</i>, and then hastened up to <i>London</i>, preached upon the same there; and though disappointed of a living preacher by the death of my son; yet I hope what happened before his birth, and since at his death, hath taught me such lessons, as, if duly improved, may render his mistaken parent more cautious, more sober-minded, more experienced in satan’s devices, and consequently more useful in his future labours to the church of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Thus, “out of the eater comes forth meat, and out of the strong comes forth sweetness.” Not doubting but our future life will be one continued explanation of this blessed riddle, I commend myself and you to the unerring guidance of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    word and spirit, and am</p>

  <p class="chaphdbrk align_rt">
    <i>London, March 12, 1744.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS leaves me just returned from <i>Gloucester</i> assizes, where it has pleased the great Judge of quick and dead to
    <a id="p055"></a>give us the victory over the <i>Hampton</i> rioters. You remember I informed you, that I thought we should be obliged to appeal unto <i>Cæsar</i>. A solemn day of fasting and humiliation was kept on that account; and accordingly last term we lodged an information against them in the <i>King’s-Bench</i>. Matters of fact being proved by a variety of evidence, and the defendants making no reply, the rule was made absolute, and an information filed against them. To this they pleaded <i>Not guilty</i>, and therefore, according to the method of the Crown-office, the cause was referred to the assizes held in <i>Gloucester</i> the third instant. Our council opened the cause by informing the court, that rioters were not to be reformers, and that his Majesty had no where put the reins of government into the hands of mobbers, nor made them either judge or jury. One of them in particular, the <i>Recorder of Oxford</i>, with great gravity, reminded the gentlemen on the jury of the advice of <i>Gamaliel</i>, “Refrain from these men and let them alone, for if this council, or this work be of man, it will come to nought; but if it be of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    ye cannot overthrow it, least haply ye be found even to fight against <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.” Our witnesses were then called. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Adams</i>
    and four more, three of which were not reputed Methodists, so clearly proved both the riot and the facts, that the judge was of opinion, there needed no other evidence. The council for the defendants then rose up, and displayed a good deal of oratory, and I think said all that could be said to mend a bad matter. One urged, “that we were enthusiasts, and our principles and practices had such a tendency to infect and hurt the people, that it was right, in his opinion, for any private person to stand up and put a stop to us; and whoever did so, was a friend to his country.” He strove to influence the jury, by telling them, “That if a verdict was given against the defendants, it would cost them two hundred pounds; that the defendants rioting was not premeditated, but that coming to hear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>,
    and being offended at his doctrine, a sudden quarrel arose, and thereby the unhappy men were led into the present fray, which he could have wished had not happened; but however, it did not amount to a riot, but only an assault.” Their other council informed the jury, “That they would undertake to prove, that the Methodists began the tumult first.” He was pleased to mention me by name, and acquainted the
    <a id="p056"></a>court, “That <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Whitefield</i>
    had been travelling from common to common, making the people cry, and then picking their pockets under pretence of collecting money for the colony of <i>Georgia</i>, and knowing that <i>Gloucestershire</i> was a populous county, he at last came there; that he had now several curates, of which <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Adams</i>
    was one, who in his preaching had found fault with the proceedings of the clergy, and had said, that if the people went to hear them, they would be damned.” He added, that “there had lately been such mobbing in <i>Staffordshire</i>, that a regiment of soldiers was sent down to suppress them; insinuating, that the Methodists were the authors; that we had now another cause of a like nature depending in <i>Wiltshire</i>, and that we were not of that mild pacific spirit, as we pretended to be.” This, and much more to the same purpose, though foreign to the matter in hand, pleased many of the auditors, who expressed their satisfaction, in hearing the Methodists in general, and me in particular, thus lashed, by frequent laughing. But our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    not only kept me quite easy, but enabled me to rejoice in being thus honoured for his great Name’s sake. To prove what the defendants council had insinuated, they called up a young man, who was a brother to one of the defendants, and one of the mob. He swore point blank, “That <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Adams</i>
    said, if people went to church, they would be damned, but if they would come to him, he would carry them to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.”
    He swore also, “that the brook into which <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>
    was thrown, was no deeper than half up his legs.” He said first, that there were but about ten of them that came to the house of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>;
    and then he swore, that there were about threescore. He said, there was a bell, and that one of the defendants did ask <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>
    to come off the stairs, but that none of them went up to him: upon which <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>
    willingly obeyed, went with them briskly along the street, and as he would have represented it, put himself into the skin-pit and brook, and so came out again. He said also some other things; but through the whole, his evidence appeared so flagrantly false, that one of the council said, “It was enough to make his hair stand <a
      id="p056a" href="#n_3">♦</a>on
    end.” The judge himself wished, “That the man had so much religion as to fear an oath.” So he went down in disgrace. Their second evidence was an aged woman, mother of one of the defendants;
    <a id="p057"></a>she swore, “That her son did go up stairs to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>, and that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>
    tore her son’s coat;” but she talked so fast, and her evidence was so palpably false, that she was sent away in as much disgrace as the other. Their third and last evidence, was father to one who was in the mob, tho’ not one of the defendants. The chief he had to say was, “That when <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>
    was coming from the brook, he met him and said, Brother, how do you do? Upon which he answer’d, that he had received no damage, but had been in the brook and came out again.” So that all their evidences, however contrary one to another, yet corroborated ours, and proved the riot out of their own mouths. The book was then given to a justice of the peace, who had formerly taken up <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>
    for preaching near <i>Stroud</i>, and had lately given many signal proofs that he was no friend to the Methodists. But he intending to speak only about their characters, and the council and judge looking upon that as quite impertinent to the matter in hand, he was not admitted as an evidence. Upon this, his Lordship with great candor and impartiality summed up the evidence, and told the jury, “That he thought they should bring all the defendants in <span
      class="smcap">Guilty</span>;
    for our evidences had sufficiently proved the whole of the information, and also, that the riot was premeditated.”—He said, “That, in his opinion, the chief of the defendants evidence was incredible; and, that supposing the Methodists were heterodox, (as perhaps they might be) it belonged to the ecclesiastical government to call them to an account; that they were subjects, and rioters were not to be their reformers.” He also reminded them “of the dreadful consequences of rioting at any time, much more at such a critical time as this; that rioting was the forerunner of, and might end in rebellion; that it was felony without benefit of clergy, to pull down a Meeting-house; and for all as he knew, it was high treason to pull down even a bawdy-house.—That this information also came from the <i>King’s-Bench</i>; that his Majesty’s justices there, thought they had sufficient reason to grant it; that the matters contained in it had been evidently proved before them; and consequently they should bring in all the defendants guilty.” Upon this the jury were desired to consider of their verdict, and for a while there seemed to be
    <a id="p058"></a>some little demur among them. His Lordship perceiving the cause of it, immediately informed them, “they had nothing to do with the damages, (that was to be referred to the <i>King’s-Bench</i>) they were only to consider, whether the defendants were guilty or not.” Whereupon in a few minutes they gave a verdict for the prosecutors, and brought in all the defendants <i>guilty</i> of the whole information lodged against them. I then retired to my lodgings, kneeled down, and with my friends gave thanks to our all-conquering <i>Emmanuel</i>. Afterwards I went to the inn, prayed and returned thanks with the witnesses, exhorted them to behave with meekness and humility to their adversaries; and after they had taken proper refreshment, I sent them home rejoicing. In the evening I preached on these words of the Psalmist, “By this I know that thou favourest me, since thou hast not suffered mine enemy to triumph over me.” <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was pleased to enlarge my heart much. I was very happy with my friends afterwards, and the next morning set out for <i>London</i>, where we had a blessed thanksgiving season, and from whence I take the first opportunity of sending you these particulars.</p>

    <i>Plymouth, June 26, 1744.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU see by this where I am. Doubtless you’ll wonder at the quick transition from <i>Portsmouth</i> to <i>Plymouth</i>. To the former I intended going when I wrote last; but just before I took leave of the dear tabernacle people, a message was sent to me, that the captain in which I was to sail from thence, would not take me for fear of spoiling his sailors. Some interpreted this as a call from providence not to embark at this time; but I enjoined them silence ’till I had taken my leave, and then, hearing of a mast-ship that was going under convoy from <i>Plymouth</i>, I hastened thither, and have taken a passage in the <i>Wilmington</i>, <abbr
      title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <i>Dalby</i>,
    bound to <i>Piscataway</i>, in <i>New-England</i>. My first reception here was a little unpromising. A report being spread that I was come, a great number of people assembled upon the <i>Hoe</i>, (a large green for walks and diversions) and somebody brought out a bear and a drum; but I did not come ’till the following evening, when, under pretence of a hue-and-cry, several broke into the room where I lodged at the inn, and disturbed me very much. I then betook myself to private lodgings, and being gone to rest, after preaching to a large congregation, and visiting the <i>French</i> prisoners, the good woman of the house came and told me, that a well-dressed gentleman desired to speak with me. Imagining that it was some Nicodemite, I desired he might be brought up. He came and sat down by my bedside, told me he was a lieutenant of a man of war, congratulated me on the success of my ministry, and expressed himself much concerned for being detained
    <a id="p060"></a>from hearing me. He then asked me, if I knew him. I answered, no. He replied, his name was <i>Cadogan</i>. I rejoined, that I had seen one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Cadogan</i>,
    who was formerly an officer at <i>Georgia</i>, about a fortnight ago at <i>Bristol</i>. Upon this, he immediately rose up, uttering the most abusive language, calling me <i>dog</i>, <i>rogue</i>, <i>villain</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    and beat me most unmercifully with his gold-headed cane. As you know I have not much natural courage, guess how surprized I was; being apprehensive that he intended to shoot or stab me, I underwent all the fears of a sudden violent death. But, as it providentially happened, my hostess and her daughter hearing me cry <i>murder</i>, rushed into the room and seized him by the collar; however, he immediately disengaged himself from them, and repeated his blows upon me. The cry of <i>murder</i> was repeated also, which putting him into some terror, he made towards the chamber-door, from whence the good woman pushed him down stairs. About the bottom of which, a second cry’d out, “Take courage, I am ready to help you;” accordingly, whilst the other was escaping, he rushed up, and finding one of the women coming down, took her by the heels and threw her upon the stairs, by which her back was almost broken. By this time the neighbourhood was alarmed. Unwilling to add to it, I desired the doors might be shut, and so betook myself to rest, not without reflecting, how indispensibly necessary it was for christians and christian ministers to be always upon their guard, and with what great propriety we are taught to pray in our excellent Litany, “from sudden,” that is, “from violent and unprepared death, good <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    deliver us.” That this may be our happy lot, is the hearty prayer of, dear Madam,</p>
  <p class="blk_90 align_ctr">

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE my last, I have had some particular informations about the late odd adventure. It seems, that four gentlemen came to the house of one of my particular friends, kindly enquiring after me, and desired to know where I lodged,
    <a id="p061"></a>that they might come and pay their respects. He directed them. Soon afterwards I received a letter, informing me that the writer was a nephew to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>,
    an eminent attorney at <i>New-York</i>; that he had the pleasure of supping with me at his uncle’s house, and desired my company to sup with him and a few more friends at a tavern. I sent him word, that it was not customary for me to sup out at taverns, but should be glad of his company, out of respect to his uncle, to eat a morsel with him at my lodgings. He came; we supped; and I observed that he frequently looked around him, and seemed very absent; but having no suspicion, I continued in conversation with him and my other friends, ’till we parted. This, I now find, was to have been the <i>assassin</i>; and being interrogated by his other companions on his return to the tavern about what he had done, he answered, that being used so civilly, he had not the heart to touch me. Upon which, as I am informed, the person who assaulted me laid a wager of ten guineas that he would do my business for me. Some say, that they took his sword from him, which I suppose they did, for I only saw and felt the weight of his cane. The next morning, I was to expound at a private house, and then to set out for <i>Biddeford</i>. Some urged me to stay and prosecute; but being better employed, I went on my intended journey, was greatly blessed in preaching the everlasting gospel, and upon my return was well paid for what I had suffered: curiosity having led perhaps two thousand more than ordinary to see and hear a man, that had like to have been murdered in his bed.

I am still here waiting for the promised convoy, and as I humbly hope, really waiting for the convoy of death to carry me to <i>Abraham</i>’s bosom. Could you think it? I have been preaching a confirmation sermon. Do you ask me where? In a Quaker’s field. As I saw thousands flocked to the church to have the Bishop’s hands imposed upon them, I thought it not improper to let them have a word of exhortation suitable
    <a id="p063"></a>to the occasion. I have also made an elopement to <i>Kingsbridge</i>, where I preached to many thousands a few days ago. It was really a most solemn occasion. A calling, inviting, persuasive gift was vouchsafed me. The hearts of the auditory seemed to be bowed as the heart of one man. Many tears were shed; but I was obliged to ride off as soon as my discourse was ended, and to return hither in the night. But blessed be God, our night was as it were turned into day. I was accompanied by several old and new converts, and we conversed in some degree, as became persons who ought to be employed every hour and every moment in trimming their lamps to be ready for the midnight cry, “Behold the bridegroom cometh!” As I am at present in this unsettled state, continually engaged in preaching, and in talking privately with many, very many awakened souls, you and my other friends must be content with receiving short, but I hope truly loving letters, from</p>

    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU know in what a poor state of health I was, when I embarked. The length, and seeming tediousness of the voyage, hath occasioned no small addition to the violent pain in my side; however, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    in a week or two after we sailed, we began to have a church in our ship. Two serious <i>New-England</i> friends finding how I was served at <i>Portsmouth</i>, came from thence to <i>Plymouth</i> in order to bear me company. We had regular public prayer morning and evening, frequent communion, and days of humiliation and fasting. Being time of war, and sailing out with near 150 ships, we had several convoys. Their taking leave of each other at their several appointed places, was striking: but ours was ordered to convoy us all the way. We were soon, and have been often alarmed. Once with the sight of a <i>Dutch</i> fleet, whom we took for an enemy; and again at the sight of Admiral <i>Balchen</i>, who rode by us receiving the obeisance of the surrounding ships, as though he was Lord of the whole ocean.
    <a id="p067"></a>It was full six weeks ere we reached the <i>Western</i> Islands, off which it being calm weather, we continued floating for some days; during which interval we were like to suffer much damage. The wind having brisked up a little, and orders being given for tacking about, one of the ships, I know not by what accident, having missed her stays, in turning, came directly upon us; I happened at that time to be singing a hymn upon deck with my little family, and thinking it best to keep there to receive the shock, I had the opportunity of seeing what passed. The ship struck her mainsail into our bowsprit, but our ship being of a large, and theirs of a smaller size, our hull received but little damage, whilst theirs received such a blow, that when disentangled from us, they were immediately apprehensive of sinking. As they again passed by us, when we expected another touch, their cries and groans were awful. O how eagerly did they cry for some signal to be given! It was done. A little after that, we came up with the convoy, and our captain informed them of what had happened. The answer was, “This is your praying, and be damned to ye.” With many expressions of the like nature. This, I must own, shocked me more than the striking of the ships. I called my friends together, and broke out into these words in prayer: “<span
      class="smcap">God</span> of the sea and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of the dry land! This is a night of rebuke and blasphemy: shew thyself, O <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and take us under thy own immediate protection; be thou our convoy, and make a difference between those that fear thee and those that fear thee not!” The disabled ship was taken into tow. Next morning they were saluted in like manner as the night before, and orders were given us to follow our convoy into <i>Fial</i>; but on a sudden a violent euroclydon arose, which not only prevented our going into <i>Fial</i>, but battered and drove away our convoy, so that we saw him no more all the voyage. For my own part, I thought it no loss; we sailed very comfortably on, ’till we were again alarmed with the sight of two ships, making up to us with all the sail they could well croud, and which our captain took to be enemies. The preparations for an engagement, to me, who you know am naturally a coward, were formidable. Guns mounting, chains put about the masts, every thing taken out of the great cabin, hammocks put about the sides of the ship, and all, except myself, seemed
    <a id="p068"></a>ready for fire and smoke. My wife, after having dressed herself to prepare for all events, set about making cartridges, whilst the husband wanted to go into the holes of the ship, hearing that was the chaplain’s usual place. I went, but not liking my situation, and being desired by one of my <i>New-England</i> friends to say something to animate the men, I crept up on deck, and for the first time of my life beat up to arms by a warm exhortation. The men seemed pleased, the apprehended enemy approached, but upon nearer view we found them not only to be friends, but the two masts ships that were going with us under the same convoy. This pleased us all. The captain taking this opportunity to clean the cabin, said, “After all, this is the best fighting:” with which you may be sure I readily concurred, praying, and believing at the same time, that all our various conflicts with spiritual enemies might, and would under the conduct of the all-conquering captain of our salvation, at last terminate in a thorough cleansing, and an eternal purification of the defiled cabin of our hearts. Committing you to his almighty guidance and protection, I subscribe myself,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">D</span>ON’T judge me for not writing more frequent. It was impracticable. I have been laid on a bed of sickness, and was, in the apprehension of myself and others, at the very mouth of the heavenly harbour; but as that more than once hath been the case, I am putting out to sea again. O who would but follow the Redeemer blindfold? No convoy like him who is the <span
      class="smcap">God</span> of the sea and the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of the dry land. After eleven weeks passage he hath brought us hither, but through my impatience and imprudence I and my friends were like to suffer loss. A little smack coming up to us just as we were near port, and being told that she would be in several hours before the ship, I, with others in complaisance to me,
    <a id="p069"></a>though persuaded to the contrary, ventured in her. It soon grew dark, our pilots missed their inlet and we were tossed about all night. My pain was great, having had for some time a nervous cholic, and I was so hungry that I could have gnawed the very boards. The fishermen had nothing but a few potatoes, of which I partook most eagerly; but withal, thought my situation to be like the poor disciples, who were rowing and toiling all night, when the wind was contrary. About the fourth watch of the night, deliverance came; the men discovered the proper inlet; but what passed before our arrival is somewhat striking to me. One of my friends, on asking what news, was answered, that the <i>New-England</i> people were turned <i>new lights</i>; which with us you know is a term for <i>heterodoxy</i>; but however, added the man, not knowing that I was lying down at his elbow, they are all expecting one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Whitefield</i>;
    and my sister, and a great company of her stamp, were yesterday all praying for his safe arrival. This made me to take courage. I continued undiscovered; and in a few hours in answer I trust to <i>new light prayers</i>, we arrived safe at <i>York</i>, a few miles off <i>Piscataway</i>, the place to which we were bound.—But you must excuse enlarging; as I recover strength you shall hear again from</p>

      class="smcap">God</span>
    appointed otherwise. In about half an hour after my arrival, I was put to bed, racked with a nervous cholic, and convulsed from the waste down to my toes. A total convulsion was immediately apprehended.</p>

    Filled with divine consolation, I begged them not to be shocked. My Saviour whispered that all was well, and therefore I desired them not to be surprized if I should be totally convulsed, or be suffered in a delirium to speak things that were wrong. Many, many of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    dearest children, through the infirmities which crazy constitutions more especially are liable to, have been called to drink such a bitter cup before me. But an all-compassionate Redeemer disappointed our fears, and exceeded our strongest expectations. Apprehended convulsions were kept off; and though I was so weak as not to be able to bear the sound of a tread of the foot, or the voice of friends who came to see and pray with me, yet my heart was kept in perfect peace. After undergoing, for about four days, fomentations and exercises of different kinds, by having my feet put into warm water, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    nature was relieved, and what I had taken four days before came away hardly discoloured. After this, whilst carried about by my tender nurse and a servant, still racked with pain, and like an helpless child, I could only say, “Look and learn what a poor creature I am.” The scene affects me yet. May it never be forgotten! I must retire, and leave enlarging to another opportunity. In the mean while, assure yourself of my being, though less than the least of all,</p>

    was with me but imprudently going over the ferry to <i>Portsmouth</i>, I caught cold, immediately relapsed, and was taken, as every one thought, with death, in my dear friend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Sherburne</i>’s
    house. My pains returned; but what gave me most concern was, that notice had been given of my being to preach the next evening. A great number of ministers and people flocked to hear; three physicians attended me, and Colonel <i>Pepperel</i> with many others were so kind as to pay me a visit and sympathize with me. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    dealt so bountifully with me, that I was enabled to tell the Colonel in particular, from heart-experience, that I felt a divine life distinct from my animal life, which made me as it were to laugh at pain; this made me determine to get up and preach, though the General and all had left me, and the person appointed to lecture in my stead was just going out of the house. My dear <i>York</i> physician was then about to administer a medicine. I on a sudden cried, “Doctor, my pains are suspended: by the help of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    I’ll go and preach, and then come home and die.” With some difficulty I reached the pulpit. All looked quite surprized, as though they saw one rose from the dead. Indeed, I was as pale as death, and told them “they must look upon me as a dying man, that I came to bear my dying testimony to the truths I had formerly preached amongst them, and to the invisible realities of another world.” Nature (by my continuing an hour in my discourse) was almost quite exhausted; but O what life! what power spread all around! All seemed to be melted, and were drowned in tears. The cry after me, when I left the pulpit, was like the cry of sincere mourners when attending the funeral of a dear departed friend. Upon my coming home, I was laid on a bed upon the ground near the fire, and I heard them say, “He is gone;” but still, you find by this
    <a id="p072"></a>I am alive, and if spared to be made instrumental in making any poor dead soul alive to <span

  <p>
    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">B</span>Y this time I suppose you have heard, by your brother’s letter, how good old <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Moody</i>,
    in his honest way, said, I was welcome to all the faithful ministers in <i>New-England</i>. But the good old man judged too much by his own honest feelings. You see I am now at <i>Boston</i>, whither I was brought from <i>Piscataway</i> in a coach and four. The joy with which I was received by the common people, cannot well be described; but many of the ministers how shy?—And how different from what once they were? When last in <i>Boston</i>, governor <i>Belcher</i> was in the chair: then, <i
      lang="la">reges ad exemplum, totus componitur orbis</i>,
    he honoured me with great honour, and the clergy paid the nod, and obeyed. In many I then perceived it was quite forced, and I think when at his table I whispered to some and said, if ever I came again, many of those who now seem extremely civil, will turn out my open and avowed enemies. The event has proved, that in this respect I have been no false prophet. You know where it is written, “There arose a king, who knew not <i>Joseph</i>.” Freed therefore from their former restraint, many have appeared in <i
      lang="la">puris naturalibus</i>.
    Some occasions of offence had undoubtedly been given whilst I was here and preached up and down the country.—Nothing however appeared but a pure, divine power working upon, converting, and transforming people’s hearts, of all ranks, without any extraordinary phænomena attending it. Good <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>
    succeeded me; numbers succeeded him. Lecture upon lecture were set up in various places; one minister called to another, to help drag the gospel net; and by all the accounts that I can have from private information, or good <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Prince</i>’s
    weekly history, which I send you with this, one would have imagined the millennium was coming indeed.
    <a id="p073"></a>But you know, in this mixed state of things, wild-fire will necessarily blend itself with the pure fire that comes from <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    altar. This the enemy long waited for; at last it broke out and spread itself; and it must be confessed, through the instrumentality of many good souls both among clergy and laity, who for a while mistaking fancy for faith, and imagination for revelation, were guilty of great imprudence. What these were, I have not time now to particularize; I can only inform you, that all is laid to me as being the <i>primum mobile</i> though there was not so much as the appearance of any thing of this nature when I left <i>New-England</i> last. But, maugre all, my poor labours are yet attended with the usual blessings, and therefore I must entreat you as usual to pray and give thanks in behalf of</p>

    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Remember you once told me, that you heard one of the good old <i>Puritans</i>, who went over to <i>New-England</i>, wrote back again, that he went from <i>Old-England</i> to avoid the Lord Bishops, and came to <i>New-England</i> to get under the Lord Brethren. Well is it at present that they are the Lord Brethren; for finding some of their pastors without cause shy of me, they have passed votes of invitation for me to preach in the pulpits, and some time ago prevailed upon me, as they heard I had done in <i>Scotland</i>, to set up a lecture at six o’clock in the morning. Not expecting a very great auditory, I opened a lecture in one of the smallest meetings, upon these words, “And they came early in the morning to hear him;” but how was I disappointed? Such great numbers flocked to hear, that I was obliged for the future to make use of two of their very largest places of worship, where I believe seldom less than two or three thousand attentive hearers hung as it were upon me, to hear the word preached. I began with the first of <i>Genesis</i>, and have now lectured in order, till I am almost come to the story of <i>Abraham</i> sending his servant to fetch a
    <a id="p074"></a>wife for his son <i>Isaac</i>. Many I trust have been made willing to say, “I will go with the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>-man, even <i>Isaac</i>’s <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.”
    It is impossible to describe the eagerness and punctuality of these early visitants. To see so many hundreds of both sexes neatly dressed, walking or riding so early along the streets to get food for their souls, has feasted my own heart. The <i>Pharaohs</i> who used to say, “Ye are idle, ye are idle,” now are struck dumb: for lecture, and family prayer, and breakfast, are now over in many houses before the sun is suffered to come into others windows; and it is now become almost a common proverb, “That between <i>Tar-water</i>, and <i>early rising</i>, the physicians will have no business.” One morning the croud was so great, that I was obliged to go in at the window. The high sheriff, who was once most forward in persecuting good <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>D――t</i>,
    being a little convinced under the word, accompanied me, and when he put his head into the window after me, the people were ready to cry out, “Is <i>Saul</i> also among the prophets?” Hoping hereafter to send you and other friends a further account of many such real instances of all-conquering grace, I subscribe myself</p>

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS leaves me just retired from my spiritual levee. Our good friend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    tells me, while I am here he looks upon his house not as his own, but mine. His parlour is large, and I sit there to receive gospel visitants. Good <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i>
    told me some time ago, that I should shortly be favoured with the company of a very pensive and uncommon person; a man of good parts, ready wit, and lively imagination, and who had made it his business, in order to furnish matter for preaching over a bottle, to come and hear, and then carry away scraps of my sermons, which it seems were to serve as texts or theses for his tavern harangues. A few nights ago he came for this purpose to Doctor <i>S――</i>’s meeting; upon my coming in, he crouded after amongst the people, and having got sufficient matter to work upon as he thought, attempted to go out; but being pent in on every side, he found his endeavours fruitless. Obliged thus to stay, and looking up to me, waiting for some fresh matter for ridicule, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was pleased to prick him to the heart. He came to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i>
    full of horror, confessed his crimes, and longed to ask my pardon, but was afraid to see me. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i>
    encouraged him to venture. This morning hearing somebody knock at the parlour door, I arose, and upon opening the door, by the paleness, pensiveness, and horror of his countenance, guessed I had met with the person of whom <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i>
    had apprized me. Immediately he cried with a low but plaintive voice, “Sir, can you forgive me?” I smiled and said, “Yes, Sir, very readily.” Indeed, replied he, Sir, you cannot when I tell you all, I then asked him to sit down; and judging
    <a id="p076"></a>that he had sufficiently felt the lashes of the law, I preached to him the gospel. That it may be the power of <span

    <i><span class="dropcap">T</span>EMPORA mutantur</i>; a confederacy, a confederacy! The clergy, amongst whom are a few mistaken, misinformed good old men, are publishing halfpenny testimonials against me. Even the president, professors, and tutors of <i>Hertford</i> college, where I was, as you know, some few years ago received with so much uncommon respect, have joined the confederacy. Good <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>,
    that venerable, truly primitive, good old Puritan, as I am informed, had many of these testimonials brought him, in order to judge of their importance. He took them, weighed them in his hands and having read them before, returned them immediately, saying, “They did not weigh much.” However, I thank <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    “out of the eater hath come forth meat.” They have done me real service. Some unguarded expressions, in the heat of less experienced youth, I certainly did drop. I was much too precipitate in hearkening to, and publishing private informations, and thereby <i>Peter</i>-like cut too many ears off: but this is my comfort, when we mean well, though no thanks to our own too forward though well-meant zeal, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    that almighty, all-compassionate physician, will heal and restore the ears again. Some good friends on my side the question are publishing testimonials in my favour. Thus you see what a militant state we are in at present. <i
      lang="la">Laudatur ab eis, culpatur ab illis.</i>
    Amidst all, the word runs and is glorified, and many are so enraged at the treatment I meet with, that they came to me lately, assuring me, that if I’ll consent, they will erect in a few weeks time, the outside of the largest place of worship that was ever seen in <i>America</i>; but you know ceiled houses were never my aim. I therefore thanked them for, but
    <a id="p077"></a>at the same time begged leave to refuse the accepting of their kind offer. How or when the present storm will subside, for subside I am persuaded it will, is as yet uncertain. I can only, at present, earnestly beg the continuance of your prayers, that whilst tossing in this floating ark I may be purged of some of my corruptions, and be kept in good temper towards those who I believe really think they do <span

  <p class="quobrk align_rt">
    <i>Boston, July 29, 1745.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Dear Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU will be surprized to hear that a messenger of the prince of peace, especially such a weak creature as I am, should beat up to arms. No doubt you have judged me, as well you may; but providence seemed to force me to it. You have now heard of the <i>Cape-Breton</i> expedition, which was carried on and finished with the greatest secrecy and expedition here, before it could be scarcely known to you at home. Worthy Colonel <i>P――</i> was fixed upon to command. The day before he accepted of the commission, he purposed to dine with me to ask my advice. I told him, “that I hoped if he did undertake it, he would beg of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord God</span> of armies
    <a id="p081"></a>to give him a single eye; that the means proposed to take <i>Louisburgh</i>, in the eye of human reason, were no more adequate to the end, than the sounding of rams horns to blow down <i>Jericho</i>; that the eyes of all would be upon him; and if he should not succeed in the intended enterprize, the widows and orphans of the slain soldiers would be like lions robbed of their whelps; but if it pleased <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to give him success, envy would not suffer him to take the glory, and therefore he should take great care that his views were disinterested, and then I doubted not, if providence really called him, he would find his strength proportioned to the day, and would return more than conqueror.” He thanked me, and his Lady having given her free consent, he commenced general. The sound now was to arms! to arms! new recruits were eagerly sought after, and my worthy friend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    was appointed one of the commissaries. Being at his house, he told me one evening that he was preparing the flag, and that I must give him a motto, and that the people must know it too. I absolutely refused, urging that it would be acting out of character; he replied, that the expedition, he believed, was of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and that if I did not encourage it, many of the serious people would not inlist. I still refused; he desired me to consider, and sleep upon it, and to give him my answer in the morning. I retired, I prayed, I slept; and upon his renewing his request in the morning, I told him, that since he was so urgent, and as I did not know but divine providence might intend to give us <i>Louisburgh</i>, therefore he might take this motto. <i
      lang="la">Nil desperandum Christo duce.</i>
    Upon this, great numbers inlisted, and before their embarkation, their officers desired me to give them a sermon: I preached from these words: “As many as were distressed, as many as were discontented, as many as were in debt, came to <i>David</i>, and he became a captain over them.” Officers, soldiers, and others attended. I spiritualized the subject, and told them how distressed sinners came to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    the Son of <i>David</i>; and in my application exhorted the soldiers to behave like the soldiers of <i>David</i>, and the officers to act like <i>David</i>’s worthies; then, I made no manner of doubt, but we should receive good news from <i>Cape-Breton</i>. After this, I preached to the general himself, who asked me if I would not be one of his chaplains: I told him, “I should
    <a id="p082"></a>think it an honour, but believed, as I generally preached three times a day in various places to large congregations I could do my King, my country, and my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    more service, by stirring up the people to pray, and thereby strengthen his and his soldiers hands.” Through divine grace, I was enabled to persist in this practice for some weeks; but at last news arrived that the case was desperate. Letter upon letter came from one officer and another to those who planned this expedition, and did not know the strength of the fortress. I smiled, and told my friends, that I believed now we should have <i>Louisburgh</i>;—that all having confessed their helplessness, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    would now reveal his arm, and make our extremity his opportunity. I was not disappointed of my hope; for one day having taken a weeping leave of dear <i>Boston</i>, and being about to preach a few miles out of the town, news was brought that <i>Louisburgh</i> was taken. Numbers flocked with great joy from all quarters, and I immediately preached to them a thanksgiving sermon from these words: “By this I know that thou favourest me, since thou hast not permitted mine enemies to triumph over me.” Here ends, dear Madam, my beating to arms. It is left to you, to judge as you please of, dear Madam,</p>
  <p class="blk_90 align_ctr">
    Yours, <abbr title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr></p>
  <p class="padr_10 align_rt">
    <i>G. W.</i></p>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    <i>Postscript.</i> I forgot to tell you, to the honour of worthy Madam <i>P――</i>, that during the time of the expedition, at her desire, I preached in the General’s house, and took the liberty before sermon, to ask her, how she came to give up the General? She answered, “That it was <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    who enabled her to do it for his glory, and her country’s good, and that now the General was gone, she had the pleasing reflection, that thro’ divine mercy, home had never been made so disagreeable to him by her conduct, as to make him wish to be gone.”</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Thank you heartily for your very kind letter, which I now snatch a few moments to answer. The account you gave of things, made me mourn that they were in so bad a situation, and at the same time I could not help rejoicing they were no worse: You and all that attended on my preaching, and had opportunities to converse with me privately, cannot be ignorant how many hints I gave of what has happened. It might have been foreseen and spoken of without a spirit of prophecy, and consequently did not so much surprise me when I found it came to pass; but I trust the storm is now blown over, and that the little flock will enjoy a sweet calm. O that your eyes may be looking towards and waiting on the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>:
    from him alone can come your salvation, he will be better to you than a thousand <i>Whitefields</i>.—I am afraid you are too desirous of having me with you; and indeed I long to see you and my other dear christian friends, but <i>America</i> seems to be
    <a id="p087"></a>my scene of action for some time. The harvest is great in many places, and the labourers are very few. I am resolved in the strength of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    to range more and more; hunting for souls is a delightful work, and I am ashamed that I do no more. O my dear man, pray for me; indeed I do for you and yours.—I am glad the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has appeared for you; he never fails those that put their trust in him; only remember, “In the world, and yet not <i>of</i> it,” is the real christian’s motto.—That <span

    she is well, and prospers both in soul and body—We talk of you often, and hope yet to live and have our hearts warmed with our <i>English</i> and <i>Welch</i> friends ere we go hence, and are no more seen. At present the cloud seems to hang over the <i>American</i> parts.—The <span

    and happy in one another.—Our <span

    willing, to set out for the northward again, and shall not lose any opportunity of writing, that offers in my way. I am sorry to hear the leaven of <i>Antinomianism</i> is not yet purged out, and that animosities are not yet ceased.—I can say nothing at this distance, but pray that the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of peace and love may direct and rule all my dear friends hearts. You will remember me to all in the most tender manner.—Indeed I omit no opportunity of sending.—I pray for you all continually, and begging a continued interest in all your prayers, I subscribe myself, my very dear brother,</p>

      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I hope I can say, that <i>Bethesda</i> was never in better order than it is now, in all probability taking root downwards, and bearing fruit upwards.—Since my arrival there this winter, I have opened a <i>Latin</i> school, and have several children of promising abilities that have begun to learn.—One little orphan, who this time twelvemonth could not read his letters, has made a considerable proficiency in his <i>Accidence</i>.—The blessed spirit has been striving with several of the children’s infant hearts, and I hope ere long to see some ministers sent forth from that despised place called <i>Georgia</i>. It is true, the constitution of that colony is very bad, and it is impossible for the inhabitants to subsist themselves without the use of slaves. But <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has put it into the hearts of my <i>South-Carolina</i> friends, to contribute liberally towards purchasing a plantation and slaves in this province; which I purpose to devote to the support of <i>Bethesda</i>.—Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the purchase is made.—I last week bought, at a very cheap rate, a plantation of six hundred and forty acres of excellent land, with a good house, barn, and out-houses, and sixty acres of ground ready cleared, fenced and fit for rice, corn, and every thing that will be necessary for provisions. One negroe has been given me.—Some more I purpose to purchase this week.—An overseer is put upon the plantation, and I trust a sufficient quantity of provision will be raised this year.—The family at <i>Bethesda</i> consists of twenty-six.—When my arrears are discharged; I purpose to increase the number.—I hope that time will
    <a id="p091"></a>soon come; and that he who has begun, will go on to stir up the friends of <i>Zion</i> to help me, not only to discharge the arrears, but also to bring the plantation lately purchased to such perfection, that if I should die shortly, <i>Bethesda</i> may yet be provided for.—As you have been such a benefactor, I thought proper to give you this particular account, that you may see it is not given in vain.—I could enlarge, but have only room to subscribe myself, generous friend,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">A</span> Few days past I had the pleasure of yours, dated <i>November</i> <abbr
      title="twenty-eighth">28th</abbr>.
    I embrace this first opportunity of returning you my hearty thanks for the unmerited kindness and affection expressed therein. May the Redeemer give me an humble heart, and grant that all favours conferred upon me by instruments, may lead me nearer to him, the source and fountain of all! But what shall I say to dear <i>New-England</i>’s sorrowful circumstances? It pities me to hear that she is still lying in the dust. However, this has generally been the case: trying and distressing times have generally followed awakening and converting times. May <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    second them with another alarm of his holy spirit, and then all will be well. Glad would I be to come and offer myself once more to do <i>New-England</i> service; but I am afraid that many ministers and the heads of the people would not bear it. However, was this my only reason, it would soon be answered.—But here are thousands in these Southern parts (as you have observed, honoured Sir), that scarce ever heard of redeeming grace and love. Is it not my duty as an itinerant, since other places have had their calls and awakening seasons, to go where the gospel has not been named? Those who think I want to make a party, or to disturb churches, do not know me. I am willing to hunt in the woods after sinners; and, according to the present temper of my mind, could be content that the name of <i>George Whitefield</i> should die, if thereby the name of my dear Redeemer could be exalted. Indeed I am amazed that he employs me at all. But what shall we say? He hateth putting away, therefore I am not consumed. Grace, sovereign free grace! shall be all my song. Last Winter’s mercies have renewed my obligations to extol free grace. I could enlarge, but several things forbid. In heaven, dear Sir, we shall have no interruptions. That you may be supported through all the fatigues of your journey thither, and with all your dear family, at length arrive at the land of eternal rest, is the earnest prayer of, honoured Sir,</p>

    <i>Postscript.</i> Fearing I shall not have an opportunity of seeing you, before you embark for <i>England</i>, it being uncertain whether your honour will be at <i>Philadelphia</i> upon my coming there, I think it my duty, honoured Sir, in this way to wish you, your honoured Lady and little Miss, an extraordinary good voyage. May the <span
      class="smcap">God</span> of the seas as well as the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of the dry land, be your convoy and pilot! May you and all who sail with you, be preserved from the hand of the enemy, and kept in perpetual peace and safety! As <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    shall enable me, my poor prayers shall follow you. They are your due, honoured Sir. The <i>Pensylvanians</i> I am sure will soon regret the loss of you, and all the friends of liberty and loyalty must be constrained to wish you well. O that the great Governor of the universe may so bless you with his holy spirit, that you may bring forth much fruit in old age! O that you may hear the great Judge of quick and dead salute you at the last day, with a “Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>!”
    This, honoured Sir, is the native language of my heart. As I trust you think me sincere, be pleased to accept it, as the best acknowledgment I can make you and your beloved consort, for all the kindnesses you have been pleased to heap on, honoured Sir,</p>

    whom your soul loves, and who has many a time shed abroad his love in your heart; how will you be surprized to see him receive you into glory, and turning your late or present <i>Egyptian</i> darkness into celestial and eternal day? May the compassionate high priest till then support your sinking spirits, and enable you to cope with and overcome all those difficulties and temptations, which either the prevalency of an inveterate melancholy, or the malice of evil spirits, may make you the subject of! Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but surely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    prays for you, though as it were behind the curtain. Excuse this freedom, reverend Sir; redeeming love constrains me to write thus. I hope you will receive it, as it is written, in much love.

How does your soul prosper in these hard, dull and afflicting times? Has tribulation produced patience, patience experience, and experience hope; and do you find thereby the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>

    I think I can say, it is good to bear the yoke of affliction in youth. It teaches one to keep silence, and weans us from a too great attachment to all sublunary enjoyments. I have a few strokes of my father’s rod from time to time, as well as you. But I find that his rod as well as his staff do comfort. I am a naughty child, and want much correction; but he that wounds, heals also, and in glory we shall find, that his loving correction hath made us great. O glory! It is yonder in view; <span

    strength is in some degree magnified in my weakness, and my preaching is blessed to poor souls. Amazing love! <i>Maryland</i> is yielding converts to the blessed <span

    The gospel seems to be moving southward. Pray for me, that I may be unwearied in well doing, and follow the Lamb whithersoever he shall be pleased to lead me. Pray remember me in the kindest manner to your aged declining pastor, the other minister who lives about five miles from you, to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>J――</i>,
    and all my kind nurses, and dear <i>York</i> friends. I find death and sickness have made great havock and alterations among them. May <span

    This consideration excites me to persist in going out into the highways and hedges.—I have been now a three hundred mile circuit in <i>Mary-land</i>, and through one or two counties in <i>Pensilvania</i>.

    <span class="dropcap">H</span>AD I strength equal to my will, you should now receive from me a very long letter; but at present I have such a fever upon me, that I can scarce send you a few lines. However I will try. Your dear letters in <i>August</i> last came to my hands last Lord’s-day.—They variously affected me, and put me on the search, whether I had neglected writing to my very dear man. Upon enquiry, I found that I wrote to you about the same time as I wrote to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>J――</i>,
    and brother <i>S――</i>, and four or five times since. Blessed be the <span
      class="smcap">God</span> and Father of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
    I am not suffered to forget old love and old friends. Indeed you are very dear to me,—all of you very dear to me still. I thank you ten thousand times for all expressions of your tender love, and for your steadiness in the truths and cause of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>;
    and hope sometimes that your prayers will draw me to <i>England</i> more speedily than I imagine. But what shall I say, my dear friend? Here are thousands and thousands in <i>America</i> who as to spiritual things know not their right hand from their left; and who are ready to hear the gospel from my mouth. Since my coming this time from <i>Georgia</i>, I have been within these five weeks a circuit of 400 miles, and every where found the fields white ready unto harvest. Nobody goes out scarcely but myself. As you are in <i>England</i> and <i>Wales</i>, the power of religion I trust will be kept up; and
    <a id="p104"></a>though my coming should be delayed some time longer, yet when I am sent, it will be with the greater blessing. I am daily finishing my outward affairs, and shall think my call clearer home, when I have provided for the support of the Orphan-house. The generous benefactor’s letter pierced my heart, made me to shed tears of love, and to put up many prayers for him. I sent him a letter from <i>Charles-Town</i> under cover to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>.
    If the person be unknown, I see no impropriety in printing my letter in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i> or <i>Evening Post</i>. I am glad you have printed my letter to the <i>Litchfield</i> clergy, and want to know what effect my sermon on the rebellion has had. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has blessed it much in these parts. I shall be glad when the great Head of the church unites dear brethren again. I trust nothing shall be wanting on my part when I come over. An union before perhaps may not be so well. However, I leave it to you, my dear Sir, and think that the bar being taken away against people’s coming to the tabernacle, may be one good step towards it. I wait upon the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    As his grace increases in the heart, I am sure his children will grow less positive and more child-like, yet more steady. O my dear man, I could write all night long, but am so giddy by hard riding and preaching constantly in the heat of the day, that I must defer being more particular till another opportunity. I hope my dear wife will supply all my deficiencies. Remember me in the tenderest manner to all. Bid them to pray me to <i>England</i>; and in the mean while, they may assure themselves they are not forgotten by, my very dear brother,</p>

Dying is exceeding pleasant to me: for the <span

    direct my steps! I am poor and needy, but the <span

    I am persuaded will be my helper. Outward affairs when I am weak pull me down; but the <span

    I heartily wish you, dear Sir, what the noble Colonel <i>Gardiner</i> once wished me, “A thriving soul in a healthy body.” Or however it may be with the one, I earnestly pray that the other may prosper. Sickness is often made use of as a means, in the hands of an all-gracious Father, to ripen our graces and fit us for heaven. Through grace, I can say it is good for me to be sick, though I am afraid I am too impatient to be gone. Well! He that cometh, will come, and cannot tarry long: till then may I be resigned, and work the works of him that sent me whilst it is day, before the night cometh when no man can work. I could proceed, but indeed, dear Sir, strength faileth me. However, I hope to see you and my other dear <i>Charles-Town</i> friends in <i>November</i>.

I would improve them in answering your kind letter, which I received yesterday. I am obliged to <i>Charles-Town</i> friends: their example will certainly influence many here.

    <a id="p108"></a>friend of sinners looks in upon, and comforts my heart. I have had loud calls to <i>England</i>. Matters go on bravely there and in <i>Wales</i>. My <i>State Sermon</i> has gone through two editions. They have also my five last sermons, which have convinced my friends that I am firm to my principles. May <span

    Your father is well, and always talking of you. Why did you not mention his wife in your letter? She is a discreet woman, and desired to be remembered to you. Every day she expects to lie in.

      title="eleventh">11th</abbr> and <abbr
      title="thirteenth">13th</abbr>.
    And to keep you no longer in suspence, I would inform you, that they have had such an effect upon me, that, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I am determined to embark for <i>England</i> or <i>Scotland</i> early next Spring.—’Till <i>Christmas</i> I am already under indissoluble engagements, and am making a strong effort, in dependance on the great Head of the church, to get free from my outward embarrassments.—I thank my dear <i>English</i> friends for what they have done for me in this respect, and must beg you, my dear and faithful brother, still to do what you can further. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    seems <i>to assure me</i> that the time of my deliverance is at hand.—I hope before this year is out, to stock my new plantation in <i>South-Carolina</i> as a <i>visible fund</i> for the <i>Orphan-house</i>, and upon news of something more being done in <i>England</i>, (so that my poor heart may no more be oppressed as it has been for many years by outward difficulties,) my answer shall be, Lo! I come once more to see my dear, very dear friends on the other side of the mighty waters. ’Till then, I shall as it were count the hours, and long for them to glide away a-pace. My dear yoke-fellow now at <i>Philadelphia</i> is like-minded, being exceedingly desirous to see her dear friends once more. May <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    grant it, if it be agreeable to his holy will! Indeed, I have lately thought I should never see you any more. For some weeks past, I have been exceedingly indisposed. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has been pleased to bring my body to the very brink of the grave by convulsions, gravel, a nervous cholic, and a violent fever. But as pain and afflictions abounded, consolations much more abounded, and my soul longed to take its flight to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    For this week past I have not preached; but since my leaving <i>Philadelphia</i>, about three days ago, I seemed to have gathered strength, and hope once more, to-morrow, to proclaim amongst poor sinners the unsearchable riches of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>. From hence
    <a id="p111"></a>I purpose to go to <i>Boston</i>, and return by land so as to reach <i>Charles-Town</i> by <i>November</i>.—Glad shall I be to receive an answer to this, about that time there.—For upon that in a great measure will depend my coming to you, or staying longer in these parts. Blessed be the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords, the door is yet open here, and I am exceedingly rejoiced to find it is kept so sweetly open at home. I can easily guess how my dear man has been tried. I find more and more that through much tribulation we must enter into glory, and by sufferings be prepared for farther usefulness here below.—O that patience may have its perfect work in our hearts. O that underneath thee may be the everlasting arms, and that by happy experience thou mayst daily prove the strength of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span> to be thine. I intend, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, to write to brother <i>J――</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    I rejoice that brother <i>E――</i> still continues in his place.—It is a token for good. You will return my most humble and dutiful respects to good Lady <i>H—g—n</i>, the Marquiss, and <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>E――n</i>.
    If possible I will write to them.—I sent letters to the Marquiss, Lord <i>L――n</i>, and Lord <i>R――a</i>, about <i>October</i> last, but suppose they have miscarried.—I leave my affairs to you, and depend on you, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    to transact them all.—The trouble is great, but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    will support and reward thee.—Near forty pounds yearly were subscribed in <i>England</i> to the <i>Orphan-house</i>, but I have not received I think above five.—I have rather more confidence in you, if possible, my very dear Man, than ever. May <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    reward thee for all thy works of faith, and labours which have proceeded of love!—I wish you joy of your little one, and most heartily salute your dear wife, and all the lovers of the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    every where. I wrote to you about a month ago in extreme weakness, and shall neglect no opportunity of sending to you.—I beseech you to continue to pray me over, and assure yourself none of you are forgotten by, my very dear Brother,</p>

      title="fifth">5th</abbr>.
    The other mentioned therein, never came to hand. I am sorry to hear there are yet disputings amongst us about brick-walls. I was in hopes, after our contests of that kind about seven years ago, such a scene would never appear again; but I find fresh offences must come, to search out and discover to us fresh corruptions, to try our faith, teach us to cease from man, and to lean more upon him, who by his infinite wisdom and power will cause, “that out of the eater shall come forth meat, and from the strong sweetness.” I am glad you find yourself happy in the holy <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    I wish thee an increase of such dear-bought happiness every day, and pray that thy mouth may not be stopped, as others have been before thee, from publishing the glad tidings of salvation, by a crucified Redeemer. It has
    <a id="p114"></a>been thy meat and drink to preach among poor sinners the unsearchable riches of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    May’st thou continue and abide in this plan, and whether I see thee or not, whether thou dost ever think of, or write to me any more, I wish thee much success, and shall always pray that the work of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    may prosper in thy hands. Whether you have changed your principles with your situation, I know not. I would only caution thee against taking any thing for <i>gospel</i> upon the mere authority of man. Go where thou wilt, though thou shouldest be in the purest society under heaven, thou wilt find that the best of men are but men at the best, and will meet with stumbling blocks enough, to teach thee the necessity of a continual dependence on the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    who alone is infallible, and who will not give that glory to another. Blessed be his Name, for the trials I have met with from the friends of <i>Zion</i>. At present, I can rejoice in being deserted by one, and used unkind by another, who at the great day must own me to be their spiritual father. Such trials are very salutary.—They lead me to the Cross, and I trust in the end will conform me to him, who in his bitterest agony had no one to watch with him, no not for one hour. My dear man, you will excuse me, as my heart at present is affected with the thoughts of the divisions that subsist between the servants and churches of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>. May <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    heal them, and hasten that blessed time, when we shall all see eye to eye, and there shall be no disputings about houses, doctrine, or discipline in all <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s holy mountain! <span
      class="smcap">God</span> willing,
    I purpose seeing <i>England</i> next year, and shall be glad to converse with thee once more, about the things which belong to our Saviour’s kingdom.—If my present sickness ends in death, we shall converse in a better world, and without the least discord and contention. Remember me to <i>Brampton</i>, and to all. I thank them for not forgetting the chief of sinners. Tell them <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is yet with me, and causes my rod to bud and blossom. The bush burns, but is not consumed. Adieu.</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span>S it not just, that I should pay off my old debts? consequently I must write to you. I owe you many letters, and more love. Accept this in part of payment. It brings you news of my safe arrival, through the good hand of my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    upon me, at <i>New-York</i>. We were detained upon the water three or four days. I believe it was for good; for the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    blessed it to the recovery of my health, so that I eat like a sailor. At present I find my nature recruited considerably, and met my dear yoke-fellow and friends well at this place. O that my heart glowed with thanks to the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords, whose mercy endureth for ever! Help me, my dear Sir, to be thankful. My obligations to my glorious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    are increased by my late excursion to <i>Charles-Town</i>, <i>Portsmouth</i>, <i>Boston</i>, and other places in <i>New-England</i>. If I forget her, let my right-hand forget her cunning. I think of, and pray for you and yours, and all my dear friends daily. O let us so live, that we may meet in heaven. You know the way; “<span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is the way, the truth and the life.” Walk before him, look continually to him, and you shall be enabled to trample upon sin, death, and hell. Excuse the brevity of this. Next time, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, you shall have a longer letter. My tender love awaits your dear spouse and family. You will remember me to all enquiring friends, and as <span

    enables, you shall all be remembered by, dear <abbr

    ’till I can preach and work no more. I doubt not, but in your sphere, you are like-minded. May the <span

    strengthen, stablish, settle you in it, and give you to abound in every good word and work. <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is a good Master: he is worthy of all our time, and of every thing that we possess. Is not one heart too little for him? And yet he requires no more. Amazing love! I am lost when I think of it. I can only say, <span

    I adore and worship! But how does dear <abbr

    I thank you, dear Sir, for all favours, and exhort

    may be at all times, your only All! O that you may look up continually to him for light, life, and every thing! Then will he direct your steps, and cause every change and scene of life to be a means of changing and transforming your dear soul more and more into his own divine likeness. You are shortly to enter into a new and untried state. Dear Sir, call <span

    and his Disciples to your marriage; marry in and for the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    or your life will be exceedingly uneasy and miserable. Remember, that new states call for new strength. Let your eyes then be fixed on <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    From him every good and perfect gift cometh. He alone can teach you to use the world, and every worldly enjoyment, so as not to abuse it. I commend you to his tender mercy. I pray continually for you, and humbly intreat you to remember unworthy, ungrateful, ill and hell-deserving me. I can now only most heartily thank you for all favours, beg to be remembered to all friends, and subscribe myself, dear Sir,</p>

    but she is gone to <i>Bohemia</i>. Accept thanks and love in her name. I have been frequently at the gates of death within these few months, and thought to have reached my desired port; but it seems I must put out to sea again. My heavenly Father’s will be done. I have good news from <i>England</i>. I have some thoughts of seeing it next year. <span

    <a id="p124"></a>from <i>Jamaica</i>. Ere long I hope to owe no man any thing but love. Something considerable hath been done since I left <i>Charles-Town</i>. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will never fail those that put their trust in him. I have remembered the book with the hymn tunes. I hope we shall not differ about an earthly matter. We are brethren; let us dwell in unity, and the <span

    of love and peace will dwell amongst us. O that his divine love may be shed abroad abundantly in our hearts by the Holy Ghost! How shall we then bear with, and forbear one another?

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Wrote to you within these few months from this place, <i>Boston</i> and <i>New-York</i>. My last letters were to inform you, that, <span

    will deliver me from money matters by and by.—He will, he will.—<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I believe, help my unbelief! I have good news from <i>Georgia</i>, and from my new plantation in <i>South-Carolina</i>. Many negroes are brought under conviction. We saw great things in <i>New-England</i>. The flocking and power that attended the word, was like unto that seven years ago. Weak as I was, and have been, I was enabled to travel eleven hundred miles and preach daily. I am now once more going to <i>Georgia</i> to settle all my affairs, and shall get ready to embark as soon as I receive letters from you. My dear yoke-fellow is gone forwards. She exceedingly longs to see her old friends. But death may intervene. I have been daily waiting for it. Few have expected my life, but at present I seem to be getting
    <a id="p126"></a>strength. By the grace of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    it shall all be employed in the dear Redeemer’s service. I find no inclination to settle. My Heart (O free grace!) is yet springing for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and I am determined to die fighting. I hope matters go on well with you. Indeed I remember you daily, and pray that you all may be filled with all the fulness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I am here travelling through a wilderness; but I trust leaning on my beloved. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span> is my rock, my stay, my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and my all. Various are the scenes I pass through; various are the comforts and supports I meet with. Sometimes the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    feeds me as it were by the ravens, and teaches me daily that man’s extremity is his opportunity to help and succour. O, my dear brother, if ever we meet in this world, how much have we to say to one another, concerning the loving-kindnesses of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?
    But when we meet in heaven.—I am lost at the thought—What!</p>

    <i>Dear and <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">N</span>OT long ago I received your kind letter, dated in <i>February</i> last. Your others I believe came to hand, and I hope ere now you have received my answer. My heart is really for an outward, as well as an inward union. Nothing shall be wanting on my part to bring it about; but I cannot see how it can possibly be effected, ’till we all think and speak the same things. I rejoice to hear, that you and your brother
    <a id="p127"></a>are more moderate with respect to <i>sinless perfection</i>. Time and experience I believe will convince you, that attaining such a state in this life, is not a doctrine of the everlasting gospel. As for <i>universal redemption</i>, if we omit on each side the talking for or against reprobation, which we may do fairly, and agree as we already do in giving an universal offer to all poor sinners that will come and taste of the water of life, I think we may manage very well. But it is difficult to determine such matters at a distance. Some time next year, (if the Redeemer spares my life) I hope to see you face to face. In the mean while, the language of my heart is,</p>
  <div class="flexctnr txt_sm">
    <div class="metered">
      <p><i>O let us find the ancient way,</i></p>
      <p class="ml_10"><i>Our wond’ring foes to move;</i></p>

      <p class="ml_10"><i>See how these brethren love.</i></p>
    </div>

  <p class="in_00 quobrk">
    I rejoice to find that the rebellion has been over-ruled for the awakening of many souls. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    generally builds his temple in troublesome times. I cannot, upon the maturest deliberation, charge myself with a design to flatter in my sermon on that occasion. You know my attachment to the present establishment. Out of the fulness of my heart my pen wrote. But it may be I know not myself. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    keep me from trimming! At present, my heart seems as free for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    as ever. I have been once more in <i>New-England</i>. My entrance was as at the first, about seven years ago. Perhaps I may embark from thence for my native country. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will direct. I am now going to <i>Georgia</i> to winter. At <i>New-York</i> and here, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    has enlarged my heart, and opened my mouth to shew forth his praise. I have news of the awakening of several negroes at my new plantation, lately purchased at <i>South-Carolina</i>. I hope ere long to be delivered from my outward embarrassments. I long to owe no man any thing but love. This is a debt, Reverend Sir, I shall never be able to discharge to you, or your brother. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    will pay you all. For his sake, I love and honour you very much, and rejoice as much, in your success as in my own. I cannot agree with you in some principles, but that need not hinder love; since I trust we hold the foundation, even “<span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    the same yesterday, to-day and for ever.” Will you salute, in the kindest manner,
    <a id="p128"></a>all the followers of the Lamb within your sphere of action? Grace, mercy and peace be multiplied upon all their dear souls! I thank them for remembering a poor pilgrim, who though faint is still pursuing, and determined, in the strength of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    to spend and be spent more and more for the good of poor sinners. Perhaps before I see you, I may visit <i>Bermudas</i> and <i>Cape-Breton</i>. You will pray that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    may order my steps aright. What have you done with the <i>Moravian Brethren</i>? their affairs are in confusion here. I think their foundation is too narrow for their superstructure. I believe in their plan there are many plants that our heavenly Father hath not planted. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    bless what is right, and rectify what is wrong in them, in us, and in all. Even so, <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    Amen!—O for heaven! where we shall mistake, judge, and grieve one another no more. Lately I thought myself sailing several times into the blessed harbour; but it seems I must put out to sea again. My Redeemer’s will be done! Forgive, Reverend Sir, the prolixity of this. Love indites. I salute you for my dear fellow pilgrim; who is gone forwards.—Continue to pray for us, and assure yourself, that you are always remembered by, Reverend and very dear Sir,</p>

    You are desolate, why should you not put your trust in the <span

    children is sweet; but communion with <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Am ashamed to think that your short though exceeding sweet and kind letter, lies as yet unanswered. Want of health and of time, (assure yourself) not want of love, has been the cause of it. The searcher of hearts alone knows, what a cordial reverential respect I bear your honoured father and mother, yourself, and dear sister. I must not write much on
    <a id="p137"></a>this head, lest my eyes should gush out with water. Sorry am I, very sorry, dear Sir, that the church is not to have the benefit of your labours. But what shall we say? <span
      class="smcap">God</span> is a sovereign <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    He must do what he will with his own. This comforts me, that I trust you have learned to be in the world, and yet not of it. Well then, since it must be so, go, dear Sir, and trade for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Let merchants see by your example, that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    can make many saints in a store. O may you daily taste, and feel the efficacy of his all-atoning, heart-cleansing, world-conquering, precious blood! I trust this is dearer and weightier to me than ever. I am now proclaiming it in these uncultivated ungospelized desarts. People hear with great attention, and I trust ere long news will be heard in heaven, that some <i>North-Carolina</i> sinners are born of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I stayed but a small time in <i>Virginia</i> and <i>Maryland</i>, that I might give this province the more time. I hope to be in <i>Charles-Town</i> in about a month, and soon after my arrival, expect to determine what course to take in the spring. Several ways present themselves. May <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    direct me which to take! Weak as I am, I am willing to spend and be spent for that ever-lovely, ever-loving <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    who has done so much for, and borne so long with me. I am afraid some of you have prayed me back into the world again. Well, it cannot be long ere I get my dismission. O for a triumphant exit. <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    keep me from going off like a snuff! But it is time to bid you good night. I have been on a forty mile excursion, and this tabernacle of mine is weak. You will remember me to all your dear family, and all friends. I will name none, that if possible I may offend none. However, this I must say, <i>New-England</i> friends are dearer to me than ever, and glad shall I be, if another sight of them before I die, be permitted to, very dear Sir,</p>

    This, and this only is the ground of our acceptance with a holy, just, and sin-avenging <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Here the sinner may find a sure asylum, an everlasting, never-failing refuge. Happy they! who begin to see, feel, and taste this, in a realizing spiritual manner. It is the budding of grace, the beginning of the kingdom of <span

      class="smcap">God</span>.
    When he puts into our hearts good desires, he expects that we shall be workers together with him. Strive therefore, on, as the word imports, <i>agonize</i> with <span

    yourself, and the world, in order that you may enter into the strait gate of a thorough sound conversion. You know who has told you “that the kingdom of <span

    suffereth violence, and the violent only take it by force.” And surely heaven is worth striving for; especially since we are sure of a conquest; and <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    the captain of our salvation, stands ready to assist, support, and strengthen at every rencounter. Learn therefore to endure hardness, like a good soldier of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>:
    adopt <i>Joshua</i>’s resolution, stand the laugh, quit yourself like a man, put your hand to the plough, and do not look back; fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life. I could write more, but I want time and paper. Blessed be <span

    My schemes are so frequently disconcerted, that I would willingly put a blank into his hands, to be filled up just as he pleases. But this stubborn will would fain avoid swallowing some wholesome bitter-sweets, which the all-gracious physician reaches out unto me. Nevertheless, through grace, the prevailing language of my heart is, “Not my will, but thine be done.” The being so long absent from my friends, sometimes a little affects me; but I have been used to so many partings, and heart-breakings from various quarters, that I wonder any thing affects, so as to surprize me. But the mystery of the cross is unsearchable. We shall never fully learn it till we die. We must be beginners in this school every day, hour, and moment. But where am I going? I write as though I was conversing with you. Perhaps such a time may come. In heaven I am sure such a time will have existence. The language of my heart is, <span

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH we are about two hundred leagues from land, yet lest hurry of business should prevent me when we get a shore, I think proper to write you a few lines whilst I am on board.—Long before this reaches you, I suppose you will have heard of what the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords was pleased to do for me and his people at, and also when we sailed from, <i>Bermudas</i>. We sailed from thence just twenty-one days this morning, and have lived, as to the conveniencies of eating and drinking, like people that came from the continent, rather than one of the islands; so bountiful were our friends, whom we left behind us. Hitherto we have met with no storms or contrary winds, only it begins to head us now. But <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    in his own time, I trust will carry us to our desired port. The first day we came out we were chased, and yesterday a large French vessel shot thrice at and bore down upon us. We gave up all for gone. I was dressing myself in order to receive our expected visitors. In the mean while, our Captain cries, “the danger is over.” The Frenchman turned about and left us. He was quite near, and we almost defenceless. Now we are so near the channel, we expect such alarms daily. If any thing happens extraordinary, I shall be particular. As for other things, I cannot say much. The Captain is exceeding civil, and I have my passage free; but all I have been able to do in the great <a
      id="p143b" href="#n_31">♦</a>cabin
    in respect to religious duties, is to read the church prayers once every evening, and twice on the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    day. I have not preached yet; this may spare my lungs, but it grieves my heart. I long to be ashore, if it was for no other reason. Besides, I can do but little in respect to my writing. You may guess how it is, when we have four
    <a id="p144"></a>gentlewomen in the cabin. However, they have been, and are very civil, and I believe my being on board has been somewhat serviceable. My health I think is improved, and I have finished my abridgment of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Law</i>’s
    serious call, which I have endeavoured to gospelize. Yesterday I likewise made an end of revising all my journals. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    for letting me have leisure to do it. I purpose to have a new edition before I see <i>America</i>. Alas! alas! In how many things have I judged and acted wrong.—I have been too rash and hasty in giving characters, both of places and persons. Being fond of scripture language, I have often used a style too apostolical, and at the same time I have been too bitter in my zeal. Wild-fire has been mixed with it, and I find that I frequently wrote and spoke in my own spirit, when I thought I was writing and speaking by the assistance of the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I have likewise too much made inward impressions my rule of acting, and too soon and too explicitly published what had been better kept in longer, or told after my death. By these things I have given some wrong touches to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    ark, and hurt the blessed cause I would defend, and also stirred up needless opposition. This has humbled me much since I have been on board, and made me think of a saying of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Henry</i>’s, “<i>Joseph</i> had more <i>honesty</i> than he had <i>policy</i>, or he never would have told his dreams.” At the same time, I cannot but bless, and praise, and magnify that good and gracious <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who filled me with so much of his holy fire, and carried me, a poor weak youth, through such a torrent both of popularity and contempt, and set so many seals to my unworthy ministrations. I bless him for ripening my judgment a little more, for giving me to see and confess, and I hope in some degree to correct and amend, some of my mistakes. I thank <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for giving me grace to embark in such a blessed cause, and pray him to give me strength to hold on and increase in zeal and love to the end. Thus, dear Sir, have I unburdened my heart to you. I look upon you to be my <i
      lang="la">fidus achates</i>,
    and therefore deal thus freely. If I have time and freedom before we land, I think to write a short account of what has happened for these seven years last past; and when I get on shore, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I purpose to revise and correct the first part of my life. I know you will pray that I may be directed and owned
    <a id="p145"></a>in every thing. I think often of, and pray for you, and as I intend writing to you again when I send this, I shall content myself at present with subscribing myself, Reverend and very dear Sir,</p>

    will grant me the last. About a month ago I left the island of <i>Bermudas</i>, where my poor labours have been greatly blessed, and your unworthy son has been honoured with many honours. I am now come once more to see my friends in my native country, and settle some affairs, and then return to <i>America</i> again. My dear yoke-fellow I have left behind, to take care of two families. I have been several times just upon the brink of eternity since I saw you, but am now a little recruited. O that my health and strength may be wholly employed for that <span

    who has done such great things for me! His blood and cross, my ever honoured mother, I trust are exceeding precious to your soul. O that I may see you laden with holiness, and bringing forth much fruit in your old age! I could say more, but have several other letters to write. As I know not how your outward affairs are situated, or where you live for a certainty, I can only send cordial and general salutations to all friends and relations. I hope you will be pleased to let me know whether you stand in need of any thing, and not cease to pray for, honoured mother,</p>

    was pleased to set his seal to my unworthy ministry in a very glorious manner.

    <span class="dropcap">A</span>T my first arrival, you judged right that I am pretty much taken up; however, I must snatch a few minutes to answer your kind, very kind letter. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that the mercies bestowed on hell-deserving me, have, through the thanksgivings of many, redounded to the glory of the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    O that the same prayers that have drawn me hither, may draw down showers of blessings upon <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    church. Now I am come, do you and my other friends continue to pray and hold up your hands, and in the strength of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    I will go on fighting. The fields seem to be as white as ever. I trust the shout of a king is among us. O for humility, love and zeal! O for that mind, which was in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>!
    I trust that the members of your society are copying after our great Exemplar. As soon as possible I purpose to come down and see you. I thank you for what you have done in respect to the Orphan-house. I could wish the cash was remitted to <i>London</i> immediately, because I want to
    <a id="p150"></a>pay it away. Surely the time will come, when I shall owe no man any thing but love. Then, and ’till the day of my death, <i>Poor, yet making many rich</i>, shall be my motto. You will remember me in the kindest manner to all the followers of the Lamb; and that you may be filled with all his fulness, is the prayer of</p>

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH I am pretty much engaged, yet I cannot let your kind letter lie by me two posts unanswered. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    that you yet retain your simple heart, and are determined to know nothing but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    and him crucified. With this mind, may you climb up higher and higher in the church of <i>England</i>, in order that you may move in a superiour orb, and your light shine with greater and more diffusive ardor round the church of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>! O my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>,
    what has the Redeemer done for us! What is he still doing! It would gladden your heart to see what a turn affairs take in <i>London</i>. I have preached twice in <i><abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew</i>’s
    church, and helped to administer the sacrament once. I believe on <i>Sunday</i> we had a thousand communicants. <i>Moor-fields</i> are as white as ever unto harvest, and multitudes flock to hear the word. The old spirit of love and power seems to be revived amongst us. What am I, what am I, that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    should still delight to honour me? O for a single eye and a simple heart unto the end! By what I can judge, satan will allure some with his golden bait. “In all times of our wealth, good <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> deliver us.” Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I am not much in danger of having too much of this world’s goods at present. My outward affairs are yet behind hand. I long to owe no man any thing but love. As for your cautions, they shall be observed punctually. Never mind me, let my name die every where, let even my friends forget me, if by that means the cause of the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    may be promoted. In
    <a id="p151"></a>about a fortnight I hope to see you at my brother’s. I hear he is better. O that he may come out for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>!
    I think I have now answered your request, and sent you a long letter. I hope to hear from you again before I see you. My hearty respects await <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>.
    I trust he determines to know nothing but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and him crucified. Commending you to his mercy, and myself to the continuance of your prayers, I subscribe myself, very dear Sir,</p>

  <p>
    <i>Honoured Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">G</span>RATITUDE constrains me to embrace the first opportunity of informing you of our safe arrival at our wished-for port. We struck ground, I think, the <abbr
      title="twenty-seventh">27th</abbr>
    day after we set sail, and landed at <i>Deal</i> the <abbr
      title="thirtieth">30th</abbr>.
    We were chased the first afternoon, and prepared for going to prison twice or thrice. But our fears were groundless; there was a cessation of arms with <i>France</i>, though we knew it not, and some ships that we thought were pursuing us proved to be <i>English</i> men of war. We had plenty of provisions, and met with no storms or bad weather worth the speaking of. Other particulars, I suppose, Captain <i>E――</i>, who was very civil, will inform you. The evening after we landed at <i>Deal</i>, I was at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>D――</i>
    and <i>E――</i>’s, before I came to my own lodgings. They were very glad to hear from <i>Bermudas</i>. Since then, words cannot well express how joyful my friends were to see me once more in the land of the living. I find the news-papers had buried me ever since <i>April</i> last; but it seems I am not to die, but live: O that it may be to declare the works of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>!
    My obligations to do so, are much increased by the mercies conferred on me at <i>Bermudas</i>, and during my voyage. Surely the stones would cry out against me, did I not set forth the riches of redeeming love. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I have had several opportunities of doing so, since my arrival. Last Lord’s-day I believe we had a thousand communicants. In a few weeks, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I purpose to
    <a id="p152"></a>see <i>Scotland</i>, and then shall do myself the pleasure of writing to, or waiting on your brother. In the mean time, I shall, as opportunity offers write to some more of my <i>Bermudas</i> friends, whom I desire never to forget at the throne of grace. You and yours, honoured Sir, will be pleased to accept my most cordial salutations. That you and your house may serve the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    here, and live with him eternally in the kingdom of heaven hereafter, is the hearty prayer of, honoured Sir,</p>

    if it be agreeable to his will, yet to prolong your life, and make your pen the pen of a ready writer. I shall take it as a great favour, if you will order me a set of your works. I shall peruse them with the greatest pleasure, and send a set of them also abroad. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    for causing you to write so to suit the taste of the polite world! O that they may be won over to admire Him, who is indeed altogether lovely! But what shall I say to your kind intended present? It is like my dear old friend. <abbr

    willing, if possible I will pay him a visit. O that he may recover his first love! For ever adored be free grace: many souls seem to be quickened. Multitudes flock to hear. My health somewhat improves, and our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    makes it exceeding pleasant to me to preach to poor sinners his unsearchable riches. O when shall we get within the veil! Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    it cannot be long. We are both sickly. <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Thank you for your kind answer to my last, as well as for all other favours.

      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    prays for us. His truths are great and shall prevail. At <i>London</i>, affairs seem to be taking a good turn. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    comes among us as in the days of old. I trust by and by we shall see good days at <i>Exon</i> again. When I shall go there is uncertain. Next week, <span

    give us a right judgment in all things! When the time of my seeing <i>Exon</i> is fixed, I will endeavour to send you previous notice.

    <span class="dropcap">G</span>LAD was I, yea very glad to receive one more letter from such a valuable and dearly beloved friend and brother. I have often enquired after you since my arrival, and only multiplicity of business prevented your hearing from me. Glory be to the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    for supporting and carrying you through so many difficulties that necessarily attend the pastoral office. I find more and more, my dear Sir, that experience is only to be learned in the school of tribulation; and as we undergo the sufferings mentioned in the scriptures, so far and no farther do we understand the scriptures themselves. O that patience may have its perfect work, and we may be enabled to the end of our days to sanctify the <span

    whom I endeavour to serve in the gospel of his dear Son, will richly reward you in that day. By his assistance, I still continue to preach the everlasting gospel in various places; and, I trust, not without some abiding good effect. Indeed, last year I was in hopes I should have been translated to those blissful regions, where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the weary be at rest. But it seems, I am not yet to die, but live. O that it may be to declare the works of the <span

    I think his glory is the main principle of my acting. I want to bring souls, not to a party, much less to lead them from the established church, but to a sense of their undone condition by nature, and to true faith in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    which will be evidenced by a holy life, and an universal, chearful obedience to all the commands of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    In this, honoured Sir, however you may judge of the means and method of my proceeding, I am persuaded you wish me success. Your’s, both in respect to this life and another, I have much at heart. That the great shepherd and bishop of souls may assist you in the oversight of all under your care, and in the future state receive you with an <i

      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and giving diligence to make your calling and election sure. O that there may be always in you such a mind! You know how many once did run well; but the devil and the world working upon their wicked hearts, have hindered them. Alas! how is their gold become dim, and their fine gold changed! Let him that thinketh he stands take heed lest he fall. Be jealous of yourself, and hang continually on the <span

    You are now growing up, and are about to launch into a wicked world. You know how strangely satan will tempt you to love it. Nothing can keep you, but the mighty power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Ask, and you shall have it exerted in your behalf. I could enlarge, but have not time. Perhaps next week I may be in <i>London</i>. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    has blessed my being in the country. The fields are white, ready unto harvest. My love to your sister. May she be a <i>Ruth</i>. For the present I must bid you farewel, after having subscribed myself,</p>

    At present, through grace, I am willing to spend and be spent for the good of precious and immortal souls. My native air seems to improve my health, and I trust ere long I shall be lively and strong as an eagle. I suppose you have heard that the word of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has been glorified in <i>Bermudas</i>. In a short time, I hope the adjacent islands will know what it is to feel the sun of righteousness arising with healing under his wings.</p>

    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS morning, just after I had begun to put pen to paper, a friend told me, that since I had been in the country, a letter had been sent me by a lady out of <i>Scotland</i>. I opened it, and with a pleasing surprize found it was from your Ladyship, to whom I was then writing. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that your soul, honoured Madam, is yet held in life! I hope it does and will prosper;
    <a id="p160"></a>and however others may grow lukewarm and lose their first love, yet you will say, “As for me and my household, we will serve the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.”
    By four years fresh experience, I find that this indeed, in every respect, is the whole of man. O how good has the blessed Redeemer been both to my soul and body! Out of how many and great deaths has he delivered me! And yet, honoured Madam, vile as I am, he is pleased still to honour me. Multitudes flock to hear the word, and our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is pleased to administer seed to the sower. Early in the Spring, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, do I purpose to visit dear <i>Scotland</i> once more. That the <span

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR kind letter, which I received but yesterday, having been taking a little tour in the country, both grieved and pleased me. Glad was I to find, that my dear old friend had not forgotten me, and yet sorry as it were, that I had not wrote to him first. I was just going to put pen to paper, when yours was brought to my hands. I read it with joy, and now embrace the first opportunity of answering it with the greatest pleasure. These words concerning our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    have always been weighty on my heart, “Having loved his own, he loved them unto the end.” They therefore that are most like him, will be most steady in their friendship, and not very readily given to change. O my dear Sir, what has the Redeemer done for us since we used to take such sweet counsel together at <i>Oxford</i>! Blessed be his name for giving you a heart still to preach among poor sinners the unsearchable riches of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    May you go on and prosper, and, maugre all opposition, see Dagon fall every where before the ark. As for me, I am a poor worthless pilgrim, and thought long ere now to
    <a id="p161"></a>be with him, who has loved and given himself for me.—But it seems I am not yet to die, but live. O that it may be to declare the work of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>!
    I think this is the thirteenth province I have been in within this twelvemonth, in each of which our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has been pleased to set his seal to my unworthy ministry. I came from <i>Bermudas</i> last, where I left many souls seeking after <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    of <i>Nazareth</i>. In <i>London</i>, <i>Bristol</i>, <i>Gloucester</i>, and <i>Wales</i>, the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i>, since my arrival, has appeared to his people. In about a fortnight I purpose leaving town again in order to go a circuit of about five hundred miles. I need not desire you to pray for me; I need not tell you how glad I shall be whenever opportunity offers, to see you face to face. In the mean while, let us correspond by letter. May <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    bless it to us both! I return cordial respects to Lady <i>M――</i>. I pray the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    to bless her and her little nursery. For the present adieu. I am, my very dear <abbr

I shall devote <i>Thursday</i> afternoon to you; and if you please to stay the evening and hear me preach, and then sup and take a bed at our house afterwards, I shall be much obliged to you. You need only enquire for the tabernacle new house near <i>Moorfields</i>. I hope matters will be so ordered, that you will be <i

    I pity persons in your circumstances, and humbly hope that you will be one of <i>Nicodemus</i>’s children every way. You know, though he came by night at first, yet afterwards he was as bold as a lion. Go on, dear Sir: “To him that hath, shall be given.” <span

    will not quench the smoaking flax, nor break the bruised reed. That his love may be shed abroad in your heart, that you may be enabled

I doubt not but you both have found, that the Redeemer’s service has been perfect freedom, and that in keeping of his commandments there is even a present great reward. Blessed be <span

    I can say so by happy and repeated experience. The blessed <span

How wonderfully does our Redeemer deal with souls. If they will hear the gospel only under a cieled roof, ministers shall be sent to them there. If only in a church, or a field, they shall have it
    <a id="p164"></a>there. A word in the lesson, when I was last at your Ladyship’s, struck me. “<i>Paul</i> preached privately to those that were of reputation.” This must be the way I presume of dealing with the nobility, who yet know not the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    O that I may be enabled, when called to preach to any of them, so to preach as to win their souls to the blessed <span

They are not, and I trust never will be forgotten by me, whilst I am on this side eternity.

I am daily employed in that delightful work of preaching to poor sinners the unsearchable riches of <span

    Once a week I read prayers and preach in one of the largest of the <i>London</i> churches. Multitudes flock there and in the fields, and I trust much good is done to many. I have been lately a three hundred mile circuit, and purpose, <span

I endeavoured to be as obliging as I could to his lady and little master, whom I suppose the Governor will have heard from before this comes to hand. I have taken the freedom to send him a volume of my sermons. I intend writing to Colonel <i>H――</i> another opportunity. I have sent

With this, I send a box of books to be disposed of among my dear <i>Bermudas</i> acquaintance. To some I have affixed their names, and lest I should have forgotten any (as undoubtedly I have, being so much hurried) I have sent half a dozen of my volumes of twenty three sermons, to be disposed of with the small tracts, as you shall think proper. I begin now to expect the <i>Diana</i>, or some other ship, to bring me an account of the welfare of you and my other beloved friends. A sense of your manifold kindnesses lies yet upon my heart, and I always endeavour to remember them before Him, who has promised that a cup of cold water given in the name of a disciple, shall in no wise lose its reward. Had I time equal to my will, I would write many letters, but a variety of business prevents. Be pleased therefore to beg my friends to accept general thanks and cordial salutations. In a few days I purpose setting out for <i>Scotland</i>, and hope to return to <i>America</i> next year. But future things belong to <span

I expect you will do this yourself, dear Sir, by and by, from the pulpit, and what is more, recommend his and your master to the choice of poor sinners. You have now by your excellent letter publickly confessed him. The eyes of all will be now upon you, to see whether the truths you have delivered to others, are transcribed into your own heart and copied in your life. Now indeed may you cry,</p>

    Now the language of your soul should be, “how holy ought I to be in all manner of conversation and godliness.” Now, dear Sir, let me entreat you to keep from trimming, or so much as attempting to reconcile two irreconcilable differences, <span
      class="smcap">God</span> and the world, <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    and <i>Belial</i>. You know me too well to suppose I want you to turn cynic. No, live a social life. But then, dear Sir, beg of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    to free you from the love of the world; thence, thence arises that fear of man which now so shackles and disturbs your soul. Dare, dear Sir, to be singularly good. If <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    be your Saviour, make him a present of your pretty character. Honour him, and he will honour you. He indulges you much, and gently leads you on. Let the same love constrain you, dear Sir, to press forwards, and never rest till you can give up children, name, life, and all into his hands who gave his precious blood for you. I could enlarge, but am called away. I make no apology for this; you say you are my friend.—Accept this, dear Sir, as a token of my believing you sincere in that profession, from</p>

    <span class="dropcap">E</span>VER since the reading your Ladyship’s condescending letter, my soul (as indeed through grace it was in a degree before) has been overpowered with his presence, who is All in All. When your Ladyship stiled me “your friend,” I was amazed at your condescension. But when I thought that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    was my friend, it quite overcame me, and made me to lie prostrate before him, crying, Why me, why me? I just now rose from the ground, after praying the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords to water your soul, honoured madam, every moment. As there seems to be a door opening for the nobility to hear the gospel, I will defer my journey till <i>Thursday</i>, and, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, preach at your Ladyship’s on <i>Tuesday</i>. In the mean
    <a id="p168"></a>while I will wait upon or send to the Count the <i>Danish</i> embassador’s brother, who favours me with his company on <i>Monday</i> to dine. On <i>Monday</i> morning from nine to near eleven I will be at your Ladyship’s, and wait to know your order concerning <i>Tuesday</i>. O that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    may be with and make me humble! I am ashamed to think your Ladyship will admit me under your roof, much more am I amazed that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    will make use of such a creature as I am. Under a sense of this, I write to your Ladyship now. It is late, and my poor body calls to rest. But as I am to preach four times to-morrow, I thought it my duty to send these few lines to your Ladyship to night. Quite astonished at your Ladyship’s condescension, and the unmerited superabounding grace and goodness of Him who has loved me and given himself for me, I subscribe myself, honoured madam,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">A</span>LTHOUGH it is time for me to be setting out, yet I dare not leave town without dropping a few lines, gratefully to acknowledge the many favours I have received from your Ladyship, especially the honour you have done me in making me one of your Ladyship’s chaplains. A sense of it humbles me, and makes me to pray more intensely for more grace, to walk more worthy of that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who has called me to his kingdom and glory. As your Ladyship hath been pleased to confer on me the honour before mentioned, I shall think it my duty to send you weekly accounts of what the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    is pleased to do for and by me. Glory be to his great Name, the prospect is promising. My Lord <i>Bath</i> received me yesterday morning very cordially, and would give me five guineas for the orphans, though I refused taking any thing for the books. I send your Ladyship (by the hands of faithful and honest <i>Betty W――</i>) a little box of my sermons, and the last account of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    dealing with me, and of the money
    <a id="p169"></a>expended for the Orphan-house, with my oath before the magistrates of <i>Savannah</i>. The little book in marble paper is for Madam <i>P――</i>: I have folded down where I would have her begin to read. What a lovely christian will she make, when grace hath once refined her heart? I hope <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    intends to honour your Ladyship in making you instrumental of doing good to the nobility. His providence, his peculiar providence hath placed your Ladyship at <i>Chelsea</i>. I am persuaded your Ladyship will not quit that post, till he that hath placed you there, plainly gives you a dismission. I have good news to-day from <i>Bristol</i>. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>
    intends to be fettered no longer with the fear of man. O that there may be always in him such a mind! <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>,
    he informs me too, is coming from under the cloud. He begs his dutiful respects may be presented to your Ladyship, and is much obliged to your Ladyship for being so much concerned for him. I hope he will fix by and by: But whither am I running? Pardon me, honoured madam, I fear I am too bold and too long. Upon the road, I propose writing your Ladyship my thoughts of what scheme seems to be most practicable, in order to carry on the work of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    both here and in <i>America</i>. I dare add no more but my hearty prayers for the temporal and eternal welfare of your Ladyship, and whole houshold, and subscribe myself, honoured madam,</p>

My attachment to <i>America</i> will not permit

    <i>My very dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR kind letter I received with great satisfaction. I chearfully sit down to answer it before I set out for <i>Scotland</i>. I have been a mile or two upon the road, but turned back because my chaise was not registered. My hands have been full of work, and I have been among great company. A privy counsellor of the king of <i>Denmark</i>, and others, with one of the Prince of <i>Wales</i>’s favourites, dined and drank tea with me on <i>Monday</i>. On <i>Tuesday</i> I preached twice at Lady <i>Huntingdon</i>’s to several of the nobility. In the morning the Earl of <i>Chesterfield</i> was present. In the evening Lord <i>B――</i>. All behaved quite well, and were in some degree affected. Lord <i>C――</i> thanked me, and said, “Sir, I will not tell you what I shall tell others, how I approve of you,” or words to this purpose. He conversed with me freely afterwards. Lord <i>B――</i> was much moved, and desired I would come and see him the next morning. I did; and his Lordship behaved with great candour and frankness. All accepted of my sermons, and seemed surprized but pleased. Thus, my dear brother, the world turns round. “In all time of my wealth, good <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    deliver me!” Glad am I, for his own sake, that dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>
    begins to resolve to play the man. Alas! a <a
      id="p170b" href="#n_12">♦</a>trimming
    conduct is uncomfortable to one’s self, displeasing to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and ridiculous in the sight of the world. <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is worth all, or he is worth nothing. May the <span

    enable me to be simple, and honest, and open in all my dealings, and
    <a id="p171"></a>to trust him with the consequences. I have ever yet found, that honesty is the best policy in the end. O that dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>
    may at length show himself a man too! My dear, very dear brother, may you lose no more time, but join in confessing a crucified Saviour. Glad am I to find that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>’s
    conversation is blest to you. I wish you had always a christian <i
      lang="la">fidus achates</i>
    at your side. Pardon me, dear brother, this freedom. My love is so great to you, and I have put up so many prayers for you, that I cannot rest till you improve those excellent parts <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has given you, for the glory of his church and the good of his people. I am glad you will send something to our mother. I need not tell you, that the wisest of men has bid us “not to despise one’s mother, when she is old.” I thank you for the pictures; I have made free with some of them already. I shall not be sorry, if you do not go to <i>Gloucester</i>. Alas, so much money spent at music-meetings will make but a poor article at the day of judgment. But where does my affection carry me? My dear brother, good night. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, you shall hear from me soon again; if you do not answer me immediately, I will impute it to any thing rather than want of love; that, I am sure, is strong towards me, however unworthy of it. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has blessed me much in <i>London</i>. Congregations are very large. On <i>Sunday</i> I was enabled to preach four times: but this body—Well! thanks be to <span

    <a id="p172"></a>scatter thy enemies! may those that hate thee be made to flee before thee! I am afraid the scene will be yet darker. But you know it is always darkest before day-break. It has been so in <i>England</i>. Matters, as to religion, were come to almost an extremity. The enemy had indeed broken in upon us like a flood. The spirit of the <span

    is now lifting up a standard. The prospect of the success of the gospel, I think, was never more promising. In the church, tabernacle, and fields, congregations have been great, and perhaps as great power as ever hath accompanied the word. A door is also opening for the mighty and noble. I have preached four times to several of the nobility at good Lady <i>H――</i>’s. All behaved exceeding well, and I suppose in the winter opportunities of preaching to them will be frequent. May the <span

      class="smcap">God</span>.
    You are not the first that have been called to part with what was as dear as their own souls, or that have seen their beloved object in the possession of another. Better see that, than enjoy the object with guilt upon the mind. How did <i>Jacob</i> smart, all his life-time afterwards, for getting the blessing by a lie? The way of duty is the way of safety. I write this on supposition that your father will be against your proceeding. You will let me know what he says: In the mean while, as our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    enables, I will pray for you. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    give us a right judgment in all things! But enough of this. You see the bishop’s charge has turned out as I supposed. Who could imagine otherwise? <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    humble thy people for giving such wrong touches to the ark! <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    keep me from doing so any more! O for zeal according to knowledge! O for grace and wisdom to act aright! Yesterday <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    brought me safe here, and I have been received very kindly. This afternoon I am to preach. The effects of it you may know hereafter. For the present, adieu. I recommend you to Him who is able to keep you from falling, and to raise you when fallen; and subscribe myself,</p>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">O</span>N <i>Thursday</i> noon, through the providence of a good and gracious <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I came hither, where I have met with an hearty welcome. Last night I preached to a <i>Moorfields</i> congregation for numbers, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I believe, was pleased to give it his blessing. I have had the pleasure of hearing, that a serjeant of a regiment, awakened when I was here last, held on, and held out, and died rejoicing; and likewise of several others, who are gone before us to inherit the promises. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    awaken fresh souls to supply their places. I trust he will. I was also much delighted last night, to hear there were so many christian soldiers among the king’s forces that came from <i>Flanders</i>. A young christian lady, under whose roof they were, told me, that some or other of them were continually praying to, and wrestling with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    If any of them return to <i>England</i>, I doubt not but <abbr
      title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> <i>G――y</i>
    will find them out. I intend writing to him soon, and hope to send our good lady some glad tidings next week. In the mean while, pray present my most dutiful respects to her Ladyship. I hope all is well in <i>London</i>. The bishop’s death, I suppose, will prevent any further stir about <i>Bartholomew</i>. I shall be glad to hear how you go on. Pray, dear Sir, how are your circumstances? You will not be offended if I inform you, that more than one have informed me of your being in debt to several. I thought it my duty to apprize you of it, because I know what a burden it is to be in debt; not indeed for myself, but for others. I make no apology for this; you know it must proceed from love. I wish you the very best of blessings, and am, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    may thereby be exalted. But then, I would not have my friends act an inconsistent part towards that friend of all, that friend of sinners, the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i>. You know, my dear Sir, what an inspired apostle hath asserted: “A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.” Whilst you are afraid of men, you will expose yourself to a thousand inconveniences. Your polite company, (unless you converse with them more as their physician, than as their companion) will prevail on you to such compliances, as will make you smart when you retire into your closet, and reflect on the part you have acted. Before I shook off the world, often have I come out of company, shorn of all my strength, like poor <i>Sampson</i> when he had lost his locks! But this is a tender point. Go on, dear Sir, and prove the strength of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    to be yours. Continue instant in prayer, and you shall see and feel infinitely greater things than you have seen or felt yet. I am of your opinion, that there is seed sown in <i>England</i>, which will in time grow up into a great tree. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    giving some of the mighty and noble a hearing ear, forebodes future good. I do not despair, if I live, of seeing you a proclaimer of the unsearchable riches of <span

    lately. I herewith send you an extract of a letter I wrote on ship-board to my dear invaluable friend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>,
    of <i>South-Carolina</i>. If it was judged proper, I would put it in the preface of a new edition of my Journals. I would not have any of my mistakes remain uncensured, uncorrected. I thank you for your hint about my way of preaching. I shall take care to observe it. And now, dear Sir, for the present, adieu. I am afraid I have tired you. I shall be fond of seeing you at <i>London</i>. Rejoicing in the prospect of seeing you in the kingdom of heaven, I subscribe myself, very dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN I was the other day at <i>Edinburgh</i>, your aged father communicated a letter to me, which gave an account of your being translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    dear Son. As the news rejoiced the hearts of angels in heaven, no wonder that it gives satisfaction to those who desire to follow the blessed <span

    The more you know of Wisdom’s ways, the more you will find them to be ways of pleasantness. The more you know of the blessed <span

    the more you will find that his yoke is easy, and his burden exceeding light. Go on then, dear Sir: be strong in the grace that is in <span

    and learn to endure hardness like a good soldier. Who knows what the <span

    hath done for your soul? O Madam, how much are you indebted to that grace which hath made such difference between you and others. To see any one converted is a miracle. But to see a rich person, one of the mighty, one of the noble converted, is yet a greater. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    add more of your rank to his church, such as shall be saved! Never fear, Madam; all things are possible to the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i>. Let him but speak the word, and great shall be the numbers of new creatures. I hope this will find you in good health, and upon the full stretch for him who was stretched and bled upon the cross for you. Great multitudes in <i>Scotland</i> flock to hear. Some of my spiritual children, I hear, are gone to heaven, and others come to me, telling what <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    did for their souls when I was here last. I desire to cast my crown before the Lamb; I desire always to be crying out, “Why me, <span

    why me?” In about a fortnight I purpose setting out for <i>London</i>. I lead a moving life. In heaven I shall have rest enough. Blessed be <span

I trust, my dear brethren, you are all thus minded; and that whatever befals you, you will, through divine assistance, hold on and hold out to the end. If I can be any way serviceable to you, be not backward to send to me. I hear of others of your profession, that have lately enlisted under the banner of the ever-blessed Redeemer.

      class="smcap">God</span>

    is pleased to smile upon my poor administrations, and very great multitudes flock to hear both in <i>England</i> and <i>Scotland</i>, yet I have thoughts of seeing <i>Bermudas</i> again next year. But I dare not determine. Future things belong to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Glory be to his great name for sending me to <i>Bermudas</i> at all! Glory be to his great name, that you, my dear Sir, are striving to enter at the streight gate of a sound conversion. I hope
    <a id="p187"></a>you will never cease striving, till you know that your Redeemer liveth.—Neither the greatness nor number of your sins can keep you from this unspeakable privilege, if you believe on the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    He is the way, the truth and the life. Come to the Father in and through him, and you, even you shall be made more than conqueror. Ere this can reach you, I hope you will have received redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of your sins. When you experience this, O how will you rejoice with joy unspeakable, even with joy that is full of glory! You will then have an heaven upon earth. Sin shall not have dominion over you. It shall not reign in your mortal body. My dear <abbr

    whilst I am musing on, and writing about this blessed change, this present salvation, the fire kindles. I love you with a peculiar love. I travail in birth till <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    be formed in your dear heart. O do not backslide. Study to improve the light and grace already received. “To him that hath shall be given,” and he shall have abundance. But I forget myself. Busy as I am, I must, you see, write a long letter. Pray return my hearty love to your dear wife, <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Am not disappointed of my hope. I thought the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    had begun a good work in your soul before I left the <i>Bermudas</i>. Your welcome letter confirmed me in this opinion. I received it with joy. Though I wrote to you not long ago, yet I must answer yours immediately. And what shall I say? May I not welcome you into the world of new creatures? May I not hope that there has been joy in heaven over you, even you, my dear Man, repenting and turning unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, even a <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span

    Surely I may. And what then does the <span

    now require of you, now he hath
    <a id="p188"></a>shewn you that good thing, the pardon of your sins, through a once crucified but now exalted Redeemer? Will you not, out of a principle of gratitude, do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with your <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?
    Methinks I hear you say, “I will, I will through the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>
    strengthening me.”—And he will strengthen you.—He has promised, that as our day is so shall our strength be.—Despised you must be, and your name shall be cast out as evil; but the glorious Redeemer will enable you to go without the camp, and cause you to rejoice when loaded with his sacred reproach. “Increase and multiply,” must now be your motto. Strive as much as in you lies, by your life and conversation, to win others to the blessed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    The eyes of men and angels will now be upon you. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    enable you to walk circumspectly to those that are without. I hope your wife and all your relations will join in going to heaven with you. I return them my most hearty love, and pray that they may be filled with all the fulness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    You will join in praying me over to the <i>Bermudas</i> again. I suppose <abbr

    <i>Very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Received yours this morning; though I am engaged this evening, yet I think it my duty to send you an immediate answer. You might well inform, and almost assure, <i>my Lord of Exeter</i>, that I knew nothing of the printing of his Lordship’s pretended charge, or of the pamphlets occasioned by it. When the former was sent to me in manuscript from <i>London</i> to <i>Bristol</i>, as his Lordship’s production, I immediately said, it could not be his. When I found it printed, I spoke to the officious printer who did it out of his own head, and blamed him very much. When I saw the pamphlet, I was still more offended; repeatedly in several companies I urged the injustice as well as imprudence thereof, and said it would produce what it did, I mean a declaration from his Lordship, that he was no Methodist. I am sorry his Lordship had such an occasion given him to declare his aversion to what is called Methodism; and though I think his Lordship in his
    declaration hath been somewhat severe concerning some of the Methodist leaders; yet I cannot blame his Lordship for saying, “that he thought some of them were worse than ignorant and misguided,” supposing that his Lordship had sufficient proof, that they either caused to be printed, or wrote again when printed, a charge which his Lordship had never owned nor published. If you think proper, dear Sir, you may let his Lordship see the contents of this. I will only add, that I wish a way could be found out, whereby his Lordship and other of the Right Reverend the Bishops, might converse with some of us. Many mistakes might thereby be rectified, and perhaps his Lordship’s sentiments in some degree altered. If this cannot be effected (I speak only for myself,) I am content to wait till we all appear before the great shepherd and bishop of souls. In the mean while, I heartily pray, that their Lordships may be blessed with all spiritual blessings, and wishing you the like mercies, I subscribe myself, very dear Sir,</p>

    deal with you? Is not the way of duty the way of safety? Should you not both agree to let matters lie as they are, and not go one step farther till you know your father’s mind? You have given him your word; you must not go back. My affair came to as near a crisis, and yet I was called to sacrifice my <i>Rachael</i>. It may not be so with you. But prepare for the
    <a id="p192"></a>worst. Assure yourself, that your present passion, at least as to the excess of it, is sinful. If all is right, why such uneasiness for such a small space of time?

    who has promised “that we shall not be tempted above what we are able to bear,” but will with the temptation make a way to escape. You see, my dear man, my love by my sympathy and plainness.

    does reign indeed, and therefore I shall be delivered out of all my troubles. You will give thanks in my behalf. He has appeared for me here.

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH I have not written to you, yet not one day hath passed since my being this time in <i>Scotland</i>, without my thinking of you. The love and respect I owe you, as an aged minister of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    will not suffer me to be silent any longer. How do you, reverend Sir? I doubt not but you find that promise true, “The righteous shall bring forth much fruit in old age.” This leaves me, though faint, yet pursuing, and resolved, in the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    to spend and be spent in the blessed cause wherein I have embarked. Indeed,
    <a id="p193"></a>when I consider my blunders, mistakes, and imprudencies, I wonder the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> does not lay me aside; but his grace is like himself, <i>infinite</i> and <i>eternal</i>. I hope he has given me a sight of, and humbled me for some of my mistakes; and I trust as I grow in years, if I am to live longer, I shall grow in knowledge and every christian virtue. Reverend and dear Sir, be pleased to pray for me. I do not forget you, though perhaps you may judge otherwise. O for heaven! There christian ministers shall see eye to eye.—But I must not weary you. In a few days I suppose you will hear what has happened in the <i>West</i>. Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>M――</i>
    perhaps may acquaint you with particulars. With this, I send you a few of my last accounts of the Orphan-house. You may dispose of them as you think proper. When you see <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    or <i>R――</i>, or any of the ministers that were friendly to me, be pleased to remember me to them in the most respectful manner. I hope <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    and your whole houshold enjoy much of Him whose presence is better than life. I earnestly entreat the <span

    magnifies his grace in being long suffering and infinitely bountiful unto me. At <i>Glasgow</i> he has magnified his strength in my weakness, and out of the eater hath brought forth meat. Next week I purpose, <span

    willing, to send your Ladyship the substance of a long debate about poor unworthy me, in the synod of <i>Glasgow</i>. Since that, I find the presbytery of <i>Perth</i> (I mean the new-fashioned part of it) has made an act against employing me. Ill-nature shews itself here, but I feel the benefit of it. Congregations are large, and I am enabled to preach with greater power, and feel unspeakable great comfort in my own soul. My hoarseness is quite gone off, my bodily health much repaired, and if my enemies shew themselves, I am persuaded the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    will bless me to his people more and more.—Some give out, that I am employed by the government to preach against the <i>Pretender</i>; and the <i>Seceders</i> are very angry with me for not preaching up the <i>Scotch Covenant</i>. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I preached up the covenant of grace, and I trust many souls are taught to profit. The inclosed, dear Madam, will shew your Ladyship a little how I have been dealt with. Particulars your Ladyship shall have when the <span

    is pleased to bring me to <i>London</i>. Next <i>Tuesday</i> sevennight I am to leave <i>Scotland</i>. Lady <i>Mary H――</i>, Lord <i>L――</i> and Lady <i>F――</i> beg their compliments may be presented to your Ladyship. Many in <i>Scotland</i> pray most earnestly for you, and <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE inclosed brings good news from a far country. The person’s mother belongs to the Tabernacle society: I lay at his house when in <i>Virginia</i>; but he and others went to cards, I thought on purpose to affront me. We retired to prayers for him. I hope they were heard. Your Ladyship will be pleased to let me have the letter again; as likewise that I sent to your Ladyship from <i>Scotland</i>, from one <abbr
      title="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <i>K.</i> of <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Helena</i>.
    Your Ladyship shall have copies of them all. I am getting the <i>New-England Christian History</i>, and <i>Bishop Hall’s Works</i> in folio, bound for your Ladyship. I find there has been a great stir in the synod of <i>Edinburgh</i> about unworthy me. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>J――</i>, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>R―― W――</i>,
    have protested against their proceedings, and appeared quite hearty. Your Ladyship wrote to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>R――</i>.
    A word or two of encouragement now from your Ladyship, would strengthen the hands of these ministers of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I hear the affair is to come before the assembly next <i>May</i>. News also was brought me last night, that the negroes are allowed by the trustees for <i>Georgia</i>. If so, that province, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, will flourish. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I am more hearty than I have been for a long season. I hope to be enabled to preach here on <i>Sunday</i> evening, and to come and preach at your Ladyship’s afterwards. Last night the gospel was indeed preached with
    <a id="p202"></a>the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven. I was shewing the dignity of a christian, and in what sense christians were kings. The King of kings was amongst us. When I hear or receive any thing that is new and good, I naturally inform your Ladyship of it, because I believe it will give your Ladyship satisfaction. I hope your new house is agreeable to your Ladyship. That the Redeemer’s glory may fill it, and that it may prove a gate of heaven to many of the rich and great, is the earnest prayer of, honoured madam,</p>

    <i>To the Honourable Lady T――.</i></p>
  <p class="quobrk align_rt">
    <i>London, <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 19, 1748.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN I was lately in <i>Scotland</i>, <abbr
      title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> <i>G――ly</i>
    wrote me word, that your Ladyship was pleased to desire my poor prayers. Before his writing, they had been put up to the throne of grace in behalf of your Ladyship very frequently; and I would then have written to your Ladyship, had I not feared it would have been making too free. Yesterday good Lady <i>H――n</i> informed me that your Ladyship was ill. Had I judged it proper, I would have waited upon your Ladyship this morning. But I was cautious of intruding. However, the regard I bear to your Ladyship, constrains me to inform your Ladyship, that my heart’s desire and prayer to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is, that this sickness may not be unto death, but to his glory, and the present and eternal good of your better part, your precious and immortal soul. This, no doubt, is the end of afflictions: <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    name and nature is Love. He cannot, therefore, chastise us for any other purpose, than that we may be made partakers of his holiness.—Every cross and disappointment, every degree of pain, brings this important call with it, “My son, my daughter, give me thy heart.” O that your Ladyship’s soul may echo back, “My heart, <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    will I give.” O that from a feeling, spiritual, abiding
    <a id="p203"></a>sense of the vanity and emptiness of all created good, you may, in a holy resentment, cry out,</p>
  <div class="flexctnr txt_sm">
    <div class="metered">
      <p><i>Be gone, vain world, my heart resign,</i></p>
      <p><i>For I must be no longer thine:</i></p>
      <p><i>A nobler, a diviner guest,</i></p>
      <p><i>Now claims possession of my breast!</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="in_00 quobrk">
    Then, and not till then, will your Ladyship’s mind be at unity with itself. Then, and not till then, will your Ladyship, upon truly rational principles, with chearfulness wait for the approach of death, and the coming of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> from heaven. It is faith in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    a true and living faith in the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that can alone bring present, real peace, and lay a solid foundation for future and eternal comfort. I cannot wish your Ladyship any thing greater, any thing more noble, than a large share of this precious faith: and a large, yea a very large share, is the glorious Redeemer ready to give to all that sincerely ask for, and seek after it. He waits to be gracious. He giveth liberally; he upbraideth not. When, like <i>Noah</i>’s dove, we have been wandering about in a fruitless search after happiness, and have found no rest for the sole of our feet, he is ready to reach out his merciful hand, and receive us into his ark. This hand, honoured madam, is he reaching out to you. May you be constrained to give your heart entirely to him, and thereby enter into that rest which remains for the happy, though despised people of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    But whither am I going? I forget that your Ladyship is indisposed, and I almost a stranger to you. I will only make this apology: “The love of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    constrains me.” Hoping, therefore, your Ladyship will excuse the freedom I have here taken, I beg leave to subscribe myself, honoured madam,</p>

    <i>Reverend and dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span>T is a concern to me, that I cannot write to more of my <i>New-England</i> friends than I do; for indeed a multiplicity of business renders a more frequent correspondence impracticable. However, I would willingly send you, dear Sir, a few lines. They are lines of love, and bring you news of my being better in health than I have been for many years last past. Several things have concurred to prove it was the divine will I should return this time to my native country. Matters were in great confusion by reason of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>’s
    going over to the <i>Moravians</i>; but blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    we are now easy at the Tabernacle, and the word falls with weight and power. In <i>Scotland</i> the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    was pleased to appear for me; I found no diminution in respect to the number of hearers; and, I believe, (thanks be to free grace) my preaching was more acceptable than ever to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    people, and to those ministers who were pleased formerly to own and encourage me. Some of the opposite party begun a like stir with that which was made in <i>New-England</i> by <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    but I believe it will only make the people more eager to hear, and in the end be productive of great good. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    orders all things well. I never enjoyed more settled peace and joy than now. I trust he has given me to see many things that were wrong, and withal a disposition to confess and amend them. At present, this is the language of my heart:</p>
  <div class="flexctnr txt_sm">
    <div class="metered">
      <p><i>Correct me when I go astray,</i></p>
      <p><i>And lead me in the perfect way.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="in_00 quobrk">
    I suppose you will be acquainted with particulars by some of my dear friends from <i>Scotland</i>. In all probability I shall go to <i>Scotland</i> again in the Spring; and, in the latter end of the year, I propose embarking for <i>America</i>. But future things belong to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Thanks be to his great name, I am willing to go
    <a id="p205"></a>any where, so that I may but glorify the dear Redeemer. Ere this reaches you, doubtless you will have heard of his giving me favour in the sight of Lady <i>H――n</i>, a Lady as good as she is great. Two or three among the great, I trust have been made the happy subjects of redeeming love. I have heard lately also of the conversion of two or three clergymen; there is likewise a great awakening in <i>Ireland</i>, and in <i>Wales</i> the work goes on. Upon the whole, I believe the gospel is getting ground, and next spring, when it is proper to range about and preach in the fields, I hope to see yet greater things. I repeat my old request, reverend and dear brother, “Pray for us.” I continually pray for you, and the people committed to your charge. I wish you and yours an increase of blessings, and beg leave to subscribe myself, Reverend and very dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">W</span>ORDS cannot well express what I felt when your welcome letter came to hand. It drew me to my knees; it made me shed tears of joy, and with two or three of my dear friends I was enabled to wrestle for you at the throne of grace. Blessed, for ever blessed be the <span
      class="smcap">God</span> and Father of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
    for opening your eyes, and giving you such an experimental and soul-ravishing knowledge of the doctrine of grace. No wonder that people take notice of you. I hope the fame thereof, as it hath reached heaven, will also be spread abroad upon the earth, and thro’ the thanksgivings of thousands redound to the glory of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I think it a happiness, that you are surrounded with many souls that have indeed tasted that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is gracious, and consequently will be fed with the sincere milk of the word, now communicated to them, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    by you. Now, my dear friend will you begin to live, now will you begin to preach indeed. Go on in the name of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and as <i>Paul</i> did, so shall you, “increase with all the increase of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.” Glad
    <a id="p206"></a>shall I be to give you all the assistance that lies in my power. <i>Henry on the Scriptures</i> will now suit your taste, and <i>Jenks upon the Righteousness of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span></i>
    might do you immediate service. <i>Flavel’s Sermons</i> would be food for you, and <i>Boston upon the Covenant</i>, and his <i>fourfold State</i>, I believe would delight you. <i>Bishop Hall’s Contemplations</i> are excellent, <i>Bishop Hopkins</i> and <i>Beveridge</i> will do for you, and indeed almost all the writers a century ago. The doctrines you now preach are no new doctrines; you are now got into the good old way. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    keep and succeed you in it, ever more and more. I believe he will. I could say more, but I expect another letter from you before I come down. Lady <i>H――</i> is rejoiced to hear of you. I read part of your letter to her last night before I preached. Some of the great ones hear the gospel gladly. That you may be made a very great blessing to thousands and ten thousands, is the hearty prayer of, my dear <abbr

In all probability, a collection might then be recommended by the general assembly, which sits next <i>May</i>, and large contributions be raised among private persons that wish well to <i>Zion</i>.

    <i>To the Honourable Trustees of Georgia.</i></p>

    <i>Gloucester, <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 6, 1748.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Honoured Gentlemen</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">N</span>OT want of respect, but a suspicion that my letters would not be acceptable, has been the occasion of my not writing to you these four years last past. I am sensible, that in some of my former letters, through hurry of business, want of more experience, and in all probability too great an opinion of my own sufficiency, I expressed myself in too strong, and sometimes unbecoming terms. For this I desire to be humbled before <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and man, knowing that, <i>Peter</i>-like, by a misguided zeal, I have cut off as it were those ears which otherwise might have been open to what I had to offer. However I can assure you, honoured gentlemen, to the best of my knowledge, I have acted a disinterested part, and notwithstanding my manifold mistakes and imprudence, I have simply aimed at <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    glory and the good of mankind. This principle drew me first to <i>Georgia</i>; this, and this alone, induced me to begin and carry on the scheme of the <i>Orphan-house</i>; and this, honoured gentlemen, excites me to trouble you with the present lines. I need not inform you, honoured gentlemen, how the colony of <i>Georgia</i> has been declining for these many years last past, and at what great disadvantages I have maintained a large family in that wilderness, through the providence of a good and gracious <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Upwards of five thousand pounds have been expended in that undertaking, and yet very little proficiency made in the cultivation of my tract of land, and that entirely owing to the necessity I lay under of making use of white hands. Had a negroe been allowed, I should now have had a sufficiency to support a great many orphans, without expending above half the sum which hath been laid out. An unwillingness to let so good a design drop, and having a rational conviction that it must necessarily, if some other method was not fixed upon to prevent it. These two considerations, honoured gentlemen, prevailed on me about two years ago, through the bounty of my good friends, to purchase a plantation in <i>South-Carolina</i>, where negroes are allowed. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    this plantation hath succeeded; and though at present I have only eight working hands, yet in all probability there will be more raised in one
    <a id="p209"></a>year, and with a quarter the expence, than has been produced at <i>Bethesda</i> for several years last past. This confirms me in the opinion I have entertained for a long time, that <i>Georgia</i> never can or will be a flourishing province without negroes are allowed. But notwithstanding my private judgment, I am determined that not one of mine shall ever be allowed to work at the Orphan-House, till I can do it in a legal manner, and by the approbation of the honourable trustees. My chief end in writing this, is to inform you, honourable gentlemen, of the matter of fact, and to let you know, that I am as willing as ever to do all I can for <i>Georgia</i> and the Orphan-house, if either a limited use of negroes is approved of, or some more indented servants sent over. If not, I cannot promise to keep any large family, or cultivate the plantation in any considerable manner. My strength must necessarily be taken to the other side. I would also further recommend it to your consideration, honourable gentlemen, whether or not as the Orphan-house was and is intended for a charitable purpose, it ought not to be exempted from all quit-rents and public taxes, as I
    believe is customary universally for such institutions to be? And as most of the land on which the Orphan-house is built, is good for little, I would humbly enquire, whether I may not have a grant for five hundred more acres that are not taken up, somewhere near the Orphan-house? My intention is, if you, honourable gentlemen, are pleased to put the colony upon another footing, (I mean in respect to the permission of a limited use of negroes) to make the Orphan-house not only a receptacle for fatherless children, but also a place of literature and academical studies. Such a place is much wanted in the southern parts of <i>America</i>; and if conducted in a proper manner, must necessarily be of great service to any colony. I can easily procure proper persons to embark in such a cause, and I do not know but several families would go over, supposing I could give them a probable prospect of a support upon their honest industry, I could say more, but I fear I have been already too prolix. I humbly recommend what has been urged to your consideration, and beg leave to subscribe myself, honourable gentlemen,</p>

I came hither last night, after having preached five times in <i>Gloucester</i>, and once in <i>Gloucestershire</i>. The glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> pleased to shine upon my administrations, and many told me they received a blessing. The bishop behaved respectfully when I was at sacrament at the cathedral, and my old tutor, <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> <i>R――</i>,
    one of the prebendaries, was very cordial when I waited upon him. I told him that my judgment (as I trust) was a little more ripened than it was some years ago, and that as fast as I found out my faults I would be glad to acknowledge them. He said, as I grew moderate, the offence the Governors of the Church had taken against me, would lessen and wear off. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I am pretty easy about that: so that I can but act an honest part, and be kept from trimming, I will, through the divine assistance, leave all consequences to him who orders all things well. Thanks be to his great name, a wonderous change is wrought on <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>.
    He came to see and hear me at <i>Gloucester</i>: his worldly shackles are dropping off apace, and his feet begin to be set in a large room. The news of his conversion hath reached <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>,
    who wrote him a long letter; but to send dissuasives to a man that hath seen and felt so much, is like throwing chaff against a brass wall. He begged me to send his duty to your Ladyship when I wrote, as does my brother, at whose house I am. I trust he is coming forwards, and that he will at length fairly shake hands with the world, and act as one alive to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I think your Ladyship meets with great encouragement. My continual prayer to the blessed Redeemer in your Ladyship’s behalf is, “that your bow may abide in strength, and the arms of your hands be strengthened by the hands of the mighty <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of <i>Jacob</i>.” He is the rock of ages. He is the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    our righteousness. In him is our strength found. Thanks be to the <span
      class="smcap">God</span> and Father of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus
    <a id="p211"></a>Christ</span>, for shewing your Ladyship the way to fetch continual strength and supplies from him! I could enlarge, but am streightened in paper. If <abbr

If only your preparations for business keep you from attending on the word preached, how will it be when you are totally immersed in it? O my dear man, let that promise of our <span

    be written on the tables of your heart, “seek you first the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>

    out of love will curse your temporal blessings. But enough of this. I hope a word to the wise is sufficient.—Since I wrote thus far, I have received a letter from good Lady <i>H――n</i>, desiring I would come up to town. I therefore propose to be with you, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, by <i>Saturday</i> night, and to preach at the Tabernacle next <i>Sunday</i>. Be pleased to apprize all friends of it. If you are at the tabernacle-house on <i>Saturday</i> evening, it would be very agreeable to,</p>

I have been at <i>Gloucester</i>, in other parts of <i>Gloucestershire</i>, and at <i>Bristol</i>, where I trust the sound of my Redeemer’s feet was heard behind me. My brother I hope is coming on. I like him better than I have for some years. He greatly regards you, and intends answering your kind letters. I proposed his meeting you here. What do you think of it? He likes it well. I wrote for him to come up next week. I expect to know by <i>Wednesday</i> or <i>Thursday</i>. If you could be here on a <span

    must be my cure. I will endeavour to keep within bounds every way. I have shewed the doctor’s letter to Lady <i>H――</i>, but she is of opinion, the journals as now corrected ought to be reprinted. In the multitude of councils there is safety; the language of my heart is,</p>

    O that my zeal may increase with prudence. I have had too little of both. I am now thirty-four years of age, and alas! how little have I done and suffered for Him, who has done and suffered so much for me! Thanks be to his great name, for countenancing my poor administrations so much! I know not how it is, but perhaps it may be to display the riches of free grace, that notwithstanding the first zeal of most, I might add, all men of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    is generally mixed with much wildfire, yet their first times have been generally blest most, especially for awakening and converting souls. Blessed be our good <span

    is coming out. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    make him a spiritual father to thousands! I smiled when you said, he would avoid the name of <i>Methodist</i>, if he could. Alas, my dear man, he might as soon think to wash a blackmoor white. The <i>Methodists</i> are now as it were a skreen for others. Formerly, if a person was serious, or preached <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    he was termed a <i>Puritan</i>, now he is a Methodist:
    <a id="p213"></a>But do you go on as you are able to bear it. Opposition shall follow you; without it, be as prudent as you will, your sincerity towards <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and love for souls cannot be evidenced. Self, love of praise, and love of the world, must come down. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    always does this, by way of sufferings inward or outward, or rather by both. One <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>
    of <i>Gloucestershire</i>, whom <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    knows, though he has begun to preach <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    but lately, yet is already warned to leave his cure. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will provide for him. He is a new creature indeed. I do not blame you for your conduct towards <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>D――</i>.
    She is a good woman, and I believe thirsts for the Redeemer’s glory. I wish she would not write so much. And what shall I say more? I hope you have had enough from me now. My very dear Sir, when am I to hear that you are a preacher of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    crucified? I long for the time, and earnestly pray that you may be freed from worldly hopes and worldly fears: for till then, I cannot believe a man, let his other accomplishments be ever so great, will be much owned and blessed by the great head of the church. I should be glad to know what my Lord of <i>Exeter</i> said. I thank the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords for giving you so much encouragement. Let this excite you to press forwards, and never fear what man or devils say of, or can do unto you. Dear, very dear Sir, my heart is enlarged towards you. I thank you, for remembering an unworthy worm before him who is the great high-priest and blessed apostle of our profession. As he enables, I shall return the favour, being, for his great name’s sake, very dear Sir,</p>

I am told the corporation have rejected you for preaching <span

    I thank you for your intended interview. Could no way be contrived for a private visit? however that be, assure yourself your interest will be much upon my heart, and if you will remember a poor unworthy worm before his throne, whose compassions fail not, you will much oblige, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

  <p>
    <i>Reverend and very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">G</span>LAD was I, yea very glad to receive your letter dated <i>November</i> <abbr
      title="seventh">7th</abbr>,
    though it did not reach me till last night. I thank you for it a thousand times. It has led me to the throne of grace, where I have been crying, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    counsel my counsellors, and shew them what thou wouldst have me to do.”—Alas, alas! how can I be too severe against myself, who, <i>Peter</i> like, have cut off so many ears, and by imprudencies mixed with my zeal, have dishonoured the cause of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>?
    I can only look up to him, who healed the high-priest’s servant’s ear, and say, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    heal all the wounds my misguided zeal has given.” Assure yourself, dear Sir, everything I print shall be revised. I always have submitted my poor performances to my friends corrections. Time and
    <a id="p215"></a>experience I find ripen men’s judgments, and make them more solid, rational, and consistent, both in their conduct and writings. O that this may be my case! O that the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    may enable me to hold on, and hold out, and keep me from flagging in the latter stages of my road. I thank you, dear Sir, for your solemn charge in respect to my health. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    it is much repaired since my return from <i>Scotland</i>, and I trust by observing the rules you prescribe (if I must live) I shall be enabled to declare the works of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    But what shall I say concerning your present trial? shall I wish you joy? Surely I may with great propriety, since an inspired writer hath said, “count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations.” But at the same time, reverend Sir, I most earnestly sympathize with you, having had the same trial from the same quarter long ago. The <i>Moravians</i> first divided my family, then my parish at <i>Georgia</i>, and after that the societies which, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I was an instrument of gathering. I suppose not less than four hundred, through their practices, have left the tabernacle. But I have been forsaken otherways. I have not had above an hundred to hear me, where I had twenty thousand, and hundreds now assemble within a quarter of a mile of me, who never come to see or speak to me; though they must own at the great day that I was their spiritual father. All this I find but little enough to teach me to cease from man, and to wean me from that too great fondness which spiritual fathers are apt to have for their spiritual children. Thus blessed <i>Paul</i> was served, thus must all expect to be treated who are of <i>Paul</i>’s spirit, and are honoured with any considerable degree of <i>Paul</i>’s success. But I have generally observed, that when one door of usefulness is shut, another opens. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    blesses you, dear Sir, in your writings; nay your people’s treating you as they are now permitted to do, perhaps is one of the greatest blessings you ever received from heaven. May patience have its perfect work, and may you be enabled to sanctify the <span
      class="smcap">Lord God</span>
    in your heart! I know of no other way of dealing with the <i>M――s</i>, than to go on preaching the truth as it is in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and rest upon that promise, “Every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be plucked up.” Seven years will make a great
    <a id="p216"></a>alteration. I believe their grand design is to extend their occonomy as far as possible. This I believe is now kept up by dint of money, and I am apt to think that the very thing by which they think to establish, will destroy their scheme. <i>John Lapidee</i> went on in the same manner in <i>Maryland</i>. His plan was raised as high, and fell as remarkably. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is a gracious Father, and will not always let his children proceed in a wrong way. Doubtless there are many of his dear little ones in the <i>M――n</i> flock; but many of their principles and practices are exceeding wrong, for which I doubt not our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will rebuke them in his own time. But I fear that I weary you. However, dear Sir, I must thank you for your sermon. It contains the very life of preaching, I mean sweet invitations to close with <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I do not wonder you are dubbed a Methodist on account of it. As it was designed for the poor, I wish it was cheaper. I think practical books cannot be too reasonable. The poor must have them cheap, and the rich will like them the better for it. And now methinks I hear you say, “But how is it at the other end of the town?” Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the prospect is promising. Last <i>Sunday</i> evening I preached to a most brilliant assembly indeed. They expressed great approbation, and some I think begin to feel. Good Lady <i>H――n</i> is indeed a mother in <i>Israel</i>. She is all in a flame for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    You may guess by a word or two in this, that she hath shewn me your last letter. I suppose she will write to you soon. But whither am I running? I quite forget myself. Love makes my pen to move too fast, and too long. Excuse it, dear Sir, and for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>’s
    sake never cease praying for, Reverend and very dear Sir,</p>
  <p class="blk_90 align_ctr">

    as you are preparing for the ministry, lose not one moment of time, but labour to be always on the stretch for Him, who was stretched on the accursed cross for you. Study books and men, but above all, study your own heart and the knowledge of <span

    and him crucified. Get your heart free from worldly hopes and worldly fears, and you will avoid thousands of those snares, into which young ministers for want of this too often fall. O let the language of your heart be, “<span

    forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of <span

Is it not time for me to begin to spend, and be spent, for him who has loved me and given himself for me? I beg your Ladyship’s prayers, and the prayers of all your dear and honoured relations. I send them all my humble and hearty respects, and beg you will accept the same from, my Lady,</p>

    You will not be offended if I tell you, that good Lady <i>H――n</i> saw your letter. She was much pleased with it, and has a great regard for you. She goes on from strength to strength. The prospect of doing good to the rich that attend her Ladyship’s house, is very encouraging. I preach twice a week, and yesterday Lord <i>B――ke</i> was one of my auditors. His Lordship was pleased to express very great satisfaction. Who knows what <span

    I thank you for your kind invitation to your house and pulpit. I would not bring you or any of my friends into difficulties, for owning poor, unworthy, ill and hell deserving me. But if providence should give me a clear call, I should be glad to come your way. I rejoice in the prospect of having some ministers in our church pulpits that dare own

  <p class="quobrk align_rt">
    <i>London, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 17, 1749.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Received your last kind letter, soon after I had been informing dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    that I did not chuse to bring my friends into trouble; but that if providence should give me a clear call, I might accept of his invitation. This perhaps may never happen. But if it should, wherefore should dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    be so much alarmed? What if his people are prejudiced against me? Might not a sermon, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    lessen their prejudices, and perhaps awaken some souls to a sense of the divine life? Such things have been done, such a thing, through the divine blessing, may be repeated again. The way of duty is the way of safety. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    requires of us to confess him in his gospel members and ministers. To be afraid of professing the one, or publicly to own, associate with, and strengthen the hands and hearts of the other, especially when they are set for the defence of the gospel, is, in my opinion, very offensive in the sight of our common <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    and can only proceed from a want of more love to him and his dear people. I am quite of your mind, my dear friend, that our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    recommends to us the wisdom of the serpent, but then it is always to be blended with the innocence of the dove. How this is done, in effect, by disowning the open and avowed proclaimers of his eternal truths, I cannot I must confess at present see into. You say, “we are most of us too warm already:” but I hope you do not think, that being ashamed of any of your <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    ministers is an instance of it? Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span> that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    seems, as you express it, “to
    <a id="p223"></a>court the enmity of mankind;” it is an error of the right side. Better so than to be afraid of it. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    never threatned to spew any church out of his mouth for being too hot; but for being neither hot nor cold he has. It is too true, my dear Sir, “we have but few faithful ministers.” But is keeping at a distance from one another the way to strengthen their interest? By no means. I rather think those that hold the same principles at least, and are embarked in the same cause, should jointly and publicly appear for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.—And
    to tell you my whole mind, I do not believe <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will bless either you or your friends to any considerable degree, till you are more delivered from the fear of man. Alas, how was you bowed down with it, when I saw you last! And your letter bespeaks you a slave to it yet. O my brother, deal faithfully with yourself, and you will find a love of the world, and fear of not providing for your children, have gotten too much hold of your heart. Do not mistake me. I would not have you throw yourself into flames. I would only have you act a consistent part, and not for fear of a little contempt be ashamed of owning the ministers of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    After all, think not, my dear Sir, that I am pleading my own cause. You are not in danger of seeing me at <i>N――n</i>. I only take this occasion of saying a word or two to your heart. You will not be offended, as it proceeds from love. You may shew this to dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>.
    I salute him, the dear doctor, and dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>,
    most cordially. I hope the seed is sown among the rich to some purpose. Last <i>Thursday</i> Lord <i>B――ke</i> was one of my hearers. Brethren pray for us; you are never forgotten by, very dear Sir,</p>

    there is yet no danger. The gospel is not got so near the court as you imagine. However, some of the mighty and noble come twice a week to hear at good Lady <i>H――n</i>’s, and the prospect of doing good amongst them is very encouraging. One or two I trust are effectually touched. Pray on, and who knows what a great fire a little spark may kindle? I wish the <span

    I would fain convince all, that I seek not theirs but them. I am sorry you have met with so many losses of late; but all our losses will be found to be gain in the end. Blessed are they that love <span

    All things are even now working together for their good. About <i>August</i> I purpose, <span

They come to thank your Ladyship ten thousand times for all favours, and to inform you that our glorious Redeemer orders all things well. On <i>Wednesday</i>, through winds, rain and frost, I reached <i>Gloucester</i>, and preached there the same evening. The next day we held out association, and, thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    affairs turned out better than expectation. I came hither this evening, where I found
    <a id="p225"></a>my brother in the very temper I could wish, “seemingly quite fixed to leave the world for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.”
    He tells me of a Colonel, who heard me once in the Summer, that now wants to know if his sins are forgiven. My brother’s visit to town has been greatly blessed to him. Surely your Ladyship will never know, till the day of judgment, the great ends <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    had in view in calling your Ladyship to <i>London</i>. I rejoice in the prospect of seeing your Ladyship happy amidst a crowd of your spiritual children, who will come to you from time to time to be built up in their most holy faith. You will suffer many pangs for them; but all shall work for your Ladyship’s present and eternal good. I suffer much in my bodily health for preaching to the nobility; but, thanks be to <span

    that some seem to have an hearing ear, and an understanding heart. My warmest prayers are continually ascending to the throne of grace for your Ladyship, and for all those who have heard the word, especially those honourable women that used to join with your Ladyship in receiving the sacred symbols of the Redeemer’s blessed body and blood.

    will note, in his book, your Ladyship’s endeavour to serve her, and reward
    <a id="p226"></a>you openly before men and angels, for this and all other your works of faith, and labours of love. I am glad your Ladyship approves of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>’s
    conduct, and that he hath preached at your Ladyship’s. The language of my heart is, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    send by whom thou wilt send, only convert some of the mighty and noble, for thy mercy’s sake! Then I care not if I am heard of no more.” I am much obliged to those honourable ladies who are pleased to send me their good wishes. In return, they have my earnest prayers that they may be filled with all the fulness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    For my own part, I long to take the field. I trust we shall see a glorious Spring, and hear of many souls crying out, “What shall we do to be saved?” Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    we have solid seasons here. I trust I can with truth say, “The gospel has been preached with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.” Next <i>Monday</i>, <span

    help me, who long ago deserved to be banished from his presence for ever, and to be employed in his work no more. I am glad your Ladyship approves of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>:
    He is, I think, a worthy man. By taking this method, your Ladyship will have an opportunity of conversing with the best of all parties, without being a bigot, and too strenuously attached to any. Surely in this your Ladyship is directed from above. The blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    cares for his people of all denominations. He is gathering his elect out of all. Happy they, who, with a disinterested view, take in the whole church militant, and, in spite of narrow-hearted bigots, breathe an undissembled catholic spirit towards all. That your Ladyship may increase and grow in this spirit, and consequently increase in true divine happiness every day, is and shall be the constant prayer of, Madam,</p>

    <i>My dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE contents of your letter surprized me; and yet it is time for me to learn to be surprized at nothing. But what shall we say? It must needs be that these trials should
    <a id="p228"></a>come, to wean us from every creature, and teach us to live by faith in the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Had you succeeded, you certainly would have met with some thorn in the flesh, to keep you from being elated too much. Persons of such sanguine dispositions as you and I are, always need one from some quarter or another. By your letter, this trial has done you good already. Be thankful for it, therefore, my dear Sir, and say from your inmost soul, “the cup, which my heavenly Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?”—We are but poor choosers for ourselves. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    sees not as we see. It is a comfort when we can say, we have eyed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in any affair; but if that affair be plainly disconcerted by his providence, we may be certain it is for good. I found it so in a like circumstance, when my affections were much more engaged than yours necessarily must have been. I wish you joy of being called to leave a worm for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and in your submission to his divine appointment. “Surely,” (says the prophet that was sent to anoint one of <i>Jesse</i>’s sons) “the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    anointed is before me.” He guessed several times; but always guessed wrong, till little <i>David</i> was sent for, who was thought nothing of. And if a prophet was mistaken, when thus sent in a peculiar manner, and no doubt particularly engaged in prayer for direction, is it any wonder, that we should find ourselves mistaken in many things, even when we have been most earnest with <span
      class="smcap">God</span> for guidance and direction? <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    often guides us by disappointments; and I doubt not but you will find some better thing is prepared for you. What the <span

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR Ladyship’s laying your commands upon me to write often, makes me uneasy unless I can redeem time to send to your Ladyship at least once a week. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I can inform your Ladyship, that there was a great stirring among the dry bones at <i>Bristol</i> and <i>Kingswood</i>. Last Lord’s-day was a great day of the Son of Man. The power of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    attended the word, as in days of old, and several persons, that had never heard me before, were brought under great awakenings. A counsellor came once, and was so affected, that when he got home he invited others to come and hear, which so alarmed his lady, (ready to die of a consumption) that she is afraid her husband will go mad. Last night I came hither, and had the pleasure of seeing some spiritual children that were begotten unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    when I was here last. This evening I am to begin to spread the gospel-net; and shall continue in <i>Exeter</i> till <i>Monday</i>. Affairs have been so confused, that it requires some time to settle them. I find a death must come upon all we do, that the life of it may appear to be wholly of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I hope your Ladyship finds that the Redeemer’s work flourishes in your hands. I long to hear, whether my letters were kindly received, and whether the seed sown by me or any other springs up. Whoever plants, or whoever waters, I know it is the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> must give the increase. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>
    is vastly attached to your Ladyship’s interest, and, I believe, prays continually for your success. Many do so, whom your Ladyship knows not. Your Ladyship’s letter to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>R――</i>
    I find is blessed much. It is
    <a id="p230"></a>the good man’s lot, that whatsoever he doth shall prosper. May this be fulfilled in your Ladyship more and more every day! I could enlarge, but must away to my delightful work. People are waiting. This late journey has been blessed to the recovery of my health. I have not had any of my usual disorders since I left town. I am sometimes faint. But, “Faint, and yet pursuing,” must be the christian’s motto. I hope my most dutiful respects will find acceptance with those honourable persons whose faces are set <i>Zion-wards</i>, and that your Ladyship will accept the same from, honoured Madam,</p>

  <p class="quobrk align_rt">
    <i>Plymouth, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 16, 1749.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE last time I wrote to your Ladyship, I was at <i>Exeter</i>, where I begun on <i>Sunday</i> evening to preach in the open air.—Abundance of souls attended, and I trust real good was done. In the morning, grace flowed richly round the congregation; and many knew experimentally that <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    was risen, by his giving them to experience the power of his resurrection in their hearts. On <i>Monday</i> I went to <i>Bovey-Tracey</i>, about 12 miles from <i>Exeter</i>, where I found several poor simple souls. Here also the fountain of life was open, and I believe some drank at, and others felt the want of it. The next morning I preached at a place called <i>Mary-Church</i>, where are supposed to be near a score of awakened souls, who have undergone much outward trouble for adhering to the cross of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Most of their bitterest opposers were present. All was calm; and the power of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    accompanied the word. After sermon I rode twenty miles to <i>Kingsbridge</i>, where, to my great surprize, I found about a thousand souls waiting till eight in the evening to hear the word. Though nature said, “Spare thyself,” I thought faith and duty said, “Venture upon the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    strength, and speak to them.” I did, from these words of our dear <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s:
    “I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is
    <a id="p231"></a>day: the night cometh when no man can work.” I preached in the street. The moon-shone. All was quiet; and I hope some begun to think of working out their salvation with fear and trembling. The next morning I preached there again; four ministers attended. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was pleased to make it a very fine season. After sermon I had the pleasure of hearing, that by two or three discourses preached at this place about 5 years ago, many souls were awakened. One young man, then called, is since a preacher; he was in a tree partly to ridicule me. I spoke to him to imitate <i>Zaccheus</i>, and come down and receive the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    The word was backed with power—He heard, came down, believed, and now adorns the gospel. From <i>Kingsbridge</i> to <i>Plymouth</i>, is near twenty post miles. Hither I came last night. About ten miles from the town, I met several of my spiritual children, who came on horseback to see me. When I came into the town, many hundreds were waiting to hear the word, and received me with great joy. Though it was past seven at night, and I had preached at <i>Kingsbridge</i> in the morning, I thought it my duty to comply with the people’s importunity, and accordingly I called upon them, (in a place stiled the tabernacle, built since I have been absent) to behold the Lamb of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I find a strange alteration in the people since I came first here, now above four years ago. Many were then awakened, and truly converted to the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    I write in a house belonging to a married couple, who call me their spiritual father. <i>Plymouth</i> seems to be quite a new place to me. I have also just now parted from a truly converted neighbouring clergyman, who has invited me to preach in his church. Ere long I hope to send your Ladyship some more good news. In the mean while, I wish your Ladyship the best of blessings; and entreat your Ladyship to pray, that a chearful, humble, simple, and guileless heart may be given to, honoured Madam,</p>

      title="twenty-ninth">29th</abbr> and <abbr
      title="thirty-first">31st</abbr>.
    I thank you a thousand times for this, and all your other favours. I did not think <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>’s
    friendship would hold long. It will be time enough for me to speak to and of him, when I see <i>Bermudas</i> again, which I propose doing, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, as soon as possible. In the mean while, I would only observe, that if I am a <i>Roman Catholic</i>, the Pope must have given <a
      id="p232a" href="#n_35">♥</a>me
    a very large dispensation. Surely <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    has acted like one, to pretend so much friendship, and express it in the strongest terms, and yet have nothing of it in his heart all the while. But thus it must be. Dear Sir, we must be tried every way. <i
      lang="la">Hic murus aheneus esto</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    As for any secrets that I told him, he is very welcome to reveal them. You know me too well to judge I have many secrets. May the secret of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    be with me! and then I care not if there was a window in my heart for all mankind to see the uprightness of my intentions. I long to have <i>Bethesda</i> a foundation for the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    If I can procure a proper solid person of good literature, who will be content to stay two or three years, something may be done. I am now in the <i>West</i>, and have begun to take the field. Great multitudes flock to hear; and our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is pleased apparently to countenance my poor unworthy ministrations. I have the pleasure of seeing the seed, which was sown just before I embarked last for <i>America</i>, spring up, producing an hundred-fold. May <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    have all the glory! Perhaps (O amazing love!) he has not done with me yet. I am better in bodily health than usual, but expect to be sick again when I return to <i>London</i>. Thither I must go in about a fortnight, to preach again to some of the Rich and Great, as well as the Poor. I find it is a trial, to be thus divided between the work on this and the other side of the water. I am convinced I have done right in coming over now; and I keep myself quite disengaged, that I may be free to leave <i>England</i> the latter end of the Summer, if our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is pleased to make my way
    <a id="p233"></a>clear. I hope, as you say nothing to the <a

    that all friends are well. I beg to be remembered to them all in the kindest manner, and depend much on their not forgetting to pray for, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Believe it will much rejoice your Ladyship’s heart to hear what is doing in the <i>West</i>. I could not have thought that the seed sown four years ago, would have met with such a great increase. But what cannot <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    do? I have now proclaimed here seven times the riches of redeeming love, to very large, attentive, and affected auditories. Generally about two thousand attend every night; and the <i>Sunday</i> evening, in the field, I believe there were above five thousand hearers. On <i>Wednesday</i>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I move hence. My short stay affects the people. But our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    orders all things well. I hope to be in town at my appointed time, at least within a few days of it. If <abbr

      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the fountain is open, and your Ladyship knows the way to it. Last Lord’s-day I administered the sacrament to some few souls that had no pastor; and I could have wished your Ladyship present to have seen an affecting sight,—two parents, both believers, presenting two daughters and a son, in the most solemn manner, for the first time to be communicants. I received them with all joy; and our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    graced the feast with much of his divine presence. Indeed, my good Lady, affairs bear a very promising aspect. I hear that much good has been done at <i>Bristol</i>. Every where fresh doors are opening, and people flock from all quarters. Prejudices, I find, do subside, and, through grace, strong impressions are made on many souls. I have not been so well, for so long a season together, for many years, as I have been since I left town. A proof, I think, that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    calls me into the fields. I hear how your Ladyship has been, by the
    <a id="p234"></a>B――p. Alas! how does the enmity of the heart sometimes make persons to forget good manners! Your Ladyship has been taught of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to forgive and pity. Well, if the great shepherd and bishop of souls has work to be done, he will raise up instruments, and find ways to send them out.</p>

    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR Ladyship’s letter I received yesterday; I trust under some sense of the honour your Ladyship has done me, through the King of kings making me instrumental in quickening or building up your Ladyship’s precious and immortal soul. Like a pure chrystal, I would transmit all the glory he is pleased to pour upon me, and never claim as my own, what is his sole propriety. Thanks be to his great and glorious name, for putting it into your Ladyship’s heart to say sincerely, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    increase my faith.” When I had read your Ladyship’s letter, I could not help observing what a connection
    <a id="p235"></a>there was between the present frame of your Ladyship’s heart, and your present circumstances in respect to your servant. For how is it, honoured Madam, that our faith is to be increased, but by our being exercised with trials? By these the christian grows; and faith, like the burning bush amidst the furnace of affliction, flourishes unconsumed. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that your Ladyship hath taken hold of a great and precious promise. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has promised, “that he will not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able to bear.” And he is faithful that hath promised. We have nothing to do, but to plead his promise in prayer. Be pleased, therefore, honoured Madam, to solace yourself, under your present distress, with these lines:</p>

      <p class="ml_10"><i>In the distressing hour.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="in_00 quobrk">
    This is, and shall be, honoured Madam, my daily prayer on your behalf. Fear not; our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will take care that all shall work for good. Those who are sincere, will soon get over such stumbling blocks; and those that are not, will stumble at any thing, nay every thing. I bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, that
    <a id="p236"></a>some have got their faces set <i>Zion-wards</i>. Of the honourable women, ere long, I trust, there will be not a few who will dare to be singularly good, and confess the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    before men. O with what a holy contempt may the poor despised believer look down on those, who are yet immersed in the pleasures of sense, and amidst all the refinements of their unassisted, unenlightened reason, continue slaves to their own lusts and passions. Happy, thrice happy they! who begin to feel and experience what it is to be redeemed from this present evil world. Well may they count all things but dung and dross for the excellency of the knowledge of <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>
    their Lord. Well may they look upon the few righteous, as the only truly excellent ones of the earth; and choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. You, honoured Madam, I trust, are one of this happy number. May all your children add to it, and follow your Ladyship, as they see you follow <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I hope that some have been inclined to list under his banner, since I left town. Indeed the glorious Redeemer has dealt bountifully with his people, and with unworthy me. The good Lady <i>H――n</i>, I suppose, hath informed your Ladyship of some pleasing particulars. I hope to acquaint you of more at my return to town.

    <a id="p238"></a>that with Queen <i>Esther</i> she may say, “If I perish, I perish.” Then shall she see the King of kings holding out a golden sceptre, and not an iron rod. But I forget myself again. Honoured Madam, be pleased to pardon me, and accept what I have written as the overflowings of a heart that hath been wrestling with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    for the salvation of your Ladyship, your honoured sister, and of all related to you. This is the best proof I can give of my being, honoured Madam,</p>

  <p>
    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER I wrote to your Ladyship last post, from <i>Plymouth</i>, I received the letters you was pleased to communicate to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>.
    They came quite unexpected. I think it is enough, that my letters are received, not without being answered; but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    will humble me by mercies. O that they may have that blessed effect upon my soul! Inclosed, your Ladyship hath my answers. I have sent them open, that your Ladyship may (if not too long) peruse them. Whilst I was writing, the fire kindled, and I did not well know how to leave off. I rejoice that your Ladyship hath such a promising prospect of doing good among the rich and great. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>,
    in his last, writes thus: “<abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>
    went with me to wait on her Ladyship; where he owns he spent two hours with more pleasure, than he ever remembered to have done in any company before: and, I must freely own, he spoke my own sentiments.” I believe that your Ladyship will daily reap the fruit of a catholic spirit, and a free conversation with the truly gracious of all denominations. It is a conduct truly god-like. Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>
    has much of it. I parted from him on <i>Thursday</i> afternoon. He was once almost blinded by weeping under the word. He was rejoiced to see the flocking at <i>Plymouth</i>. Indeed it was very encouraging. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    seemed to keep the best wine until the last. At <i>Tavistock</i>, ten miles from <i>Plymouth</i>, I preached
    <a id="p239"></a>last <i>Thursday</i>, but was rudely treated. For, whilst I was praying, some of the baser sort brought a bull and dogs, and disturbed us much. But I hope that good was done. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    we know some has been done. I conversed with three or four, that have been awakened by the reading of some of my printed sermons. Surely the Apostle spoke like himself, when he said, “<span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has chosen the weak things of this world, to confound the strong; and things that are not, to bring to nought the things that are.” I am now come thus far in my return to <i>London</i>. I purpose, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, being there in about ten days. On <i>Monday</i> next I shall set out for <i>Bristol</i>; where, as I am informed, the infinitely condescending Redeemer has been pleased greatly to bless my last visit. When I think of <i>London</i>, I feel a kind of fear and trembling, lest my bodily sickness should return again, and I should not speak to the Mighty and Noble, so as to win them to the ever-blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    But I desire to throw myself blindfold into his hands, believing, (<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    help my unbelief!) that as my day is, so shall my strength be. At present, honoured Madam, this is the language of my heart, to Him, whose I am, and whom I desire to serve:</p>
  <div class="flexctnr txt_sm">
    <div class="metered">
      <p><i>A life that all things casts behind,</i></p>
      <p><i>Springs forth obedient to thy call;</i></p>
      <p><i>A heart, that no desire can move,</i></p>
      <p><i>But still t’adore, believe, and love,</i></p>
      <p><i>Give me, my <span
          class="smcap">Lord</span>, my life, my all!</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="in_00 quobrk">

This post carries answers to the honourable women. I suppose that you will be pleased to find I am thus far in my return to <i>London</i>. O my friend, my friend, I come with fear and trembling. To speak to the rich and great, so as to win them to the blessed <span

Why do you not preach or print? At least, why do you not help me, or somebody or another, in a more public way? You are in the decline of life, and if you do not soon reassume the place, you are now, through grace, qualified for, you may lose the opportunity of doing so for ever.

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Am ashamed to think that your last kind letter has lain by so long unanswered; but journeying, preaching, and a multiplicity of other business has prevented me. I shall not carry on
    <a id="p241"></a>the debate; only I must thank you for receiving my letter in so friendly a manner, and entreat you, though a host of enemies are behind, and a whole sea of troubles before you, to go forwards. That was the command the great <span
      class="smcap">Jehovah</span>
    gave to his servant <i>Moses</i>, when under very pressing circumstances, so that he knew not what to do. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    impressing and affecting persons under your exhortation, is a token for good. It is good to be led on step by step into whatever plan providence intends to call us. “He that believeth doth not make haste.” Our business is to follow, and improve the light we have, and that is the way to get more. You know who hath said, “to him that hath shall be given, and he shall have more abundance.” May this promise be fulfilled in your heart! But why does my friend write so about assurance, or think he is too sinful to expect such a favour? Have you learnt <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    no better yet? Who more sinful than <i>Paul</i> or the jaylor, <i>Zaccheus</i> or <i>Magdalene</i>? and who more assured of their salvation? My dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>,
    do not think so hardly of the glorious Redeemer. Draw near to him with boldness, though the greatest of sinners, and urge that as an argument, why he should give you the greatest and most abiding assurance of his everlasting love. This is the only argument I can use in respect to my own soul. Fear not, dear Sir, though clouds return after the rain; ere long I trust the glorious and ever-blessed spirit will not, as to his comforts, be like a way-faring man, tarrying only for a night, but come and make a continued abode in your heart. The language of my soul for you is, “Come <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    come quickly!” May I expect an answer to this in <i>London</i>. Thither I am now going from the west, where I have been for about a month, and through grace have seen that the seed sown just before my embarking last for <i>America</i>, has sprung up and produced fruit unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    To him be all the glory. The impressions made upon some of the great ones do remain. Good Lady <i>H――</i> sends me good news. Be pleased to remember me as usual to doctor <i>D――</i> and <abbr

  <p>
    <i>Reverend and dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Am much obliged to you for your last kind letter. It was so agreeable, that I sent it to good Lady <i>H――</i>. Her Ladyship writes me word “that it was a letter after her own heart.” She loves a Catholic spirit, and I trust you are not deceived in your thoughts concerning me in this respect. If I know any thing of my desperately wicked and deceitful heart, I truly love all that love the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i>, and though I cannot depart from the principles which I believe are clearly revealed in the book of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    yet I can chearfully associate with those that differ from me, if I have reason to think they are united to our common head. This induced me to call upon good <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>,
    whose books many years ago were blessed to my soul, when the work that is now spreading, was then only in embryo. I am just come from the west, where I have had the pleasure of seeing the seed sown just before I last embarked for <i>America</i>, sprung up and bearing much fruit. All glory be to Him who alone giveth the increase. I have also had two letters from some honourable women, who I trust have received the grace of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in truth; and Lady <i>H――n</i> writes me word, that “the prospect of doing good at my return to <i>London</i> is very encouraging.” Thither I am now bound. I go with fear and trembling, knowing how difficult it is to speak to the great, so as to win them to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I sometimes am ready to say, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    I pray thee have me excused, and send by whom thou wilt send.” But divine grace is sufficient for me. I can do all things through <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    strengthening me. My dear brother, fail not to pray for me, that I may hold on and hold out to the end, and in prosperity and adversity press forward with an even, chearful, meek and lowly mind towards the mark, for the prize of our high calling in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.
    I am glad to hear that doctor <i>S――</i> goes on so well. I guess he will not be suffered long to halt. It is no matter how soon all worldly shackles are knocked off, and persons set at liberty
    <a id="p243"></a>(supposing they have a proper call) to range for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I find there is no hopes of compromising matters. Nobody can be ordained that is a Methodist. Well! the time may come, when many of the priests also shall be obedient to the word. They come last; but then many of them come together. I know you will say, Amen! let me hear from you shortly again. You shall have as quick returns as can be given you by, my dear brother,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have just now heard, that a ship will sail for <i>Philadelphia</i> in a day or two. I cannot therefore miss the opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your last kind letter. I am sorry it brought me such bad news concerning the state of religion in your parts. My constant prayer for you, and my other <i>Philadelphia</i> friends is this, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    revive thy work in the midst of the years.” Notwithstanding so wide a door is opened here, and a prospect of doing much good lies before me, yet I have settled thoughts of embarking for <i>America</i> in the fall. But future things belong to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    His I am, and I desire to be entirely at his alwise disposal. My wife is not yet arrived; I hear she is yet upon the water. May the <span

I am just returned from an excursion of about six hundred miles in the west, where I had the pleasure of seeing, that the seed sown before I embarked last for <i>America</i>, had been blessed abundantly. Glory be to Him, who alone has given the increase. The news you have had of my preaching to some great ones, is true; I have done it for some time twice a week, and thanks be to the blessed Redeemer, it has already produced good effects. Lady <i>H――</i> is a mirror of piety indeed. In time, I trust of the honourable women there will not be a few, who dare to confess the <span

    be with all your spirits, Amen and Amen! The bearer, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>,
    seems to be well recommended as an honest man. He is an entire stranger to every body in <i>America</i>, and I believe has a mind to settle in <i>Philadelphia</i>. I am desired to write a line in his behalf. You will do what you can for him, because he is a stranger. I could write much more, but am interrupted. Adieu, my dear man, for the present.

    you have at length found out, that whosoever attempts to reconcile <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and the world, is attempting to reconcile two irreconcilable differences. They are as opposite as light and darkness, heaven and hell. You have nothing to do, but to go on doing, and then sing with an holy triumph,</p>

    You know he is faithful, who hath promised, “that he will never leave nor forsake you.” Wait on him therefore, dear Sir, and you shall renew your strength, nay you shall mount on wings like an eagle; you shall walk and not be weary, you shall run and not be faint. Various are the trials inward and outward that you will meet with. It is in the spiritual as in the natural birth. The after-pangs are sometimes sharper than those that precede the new-birth itself. If you are made use of by <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    no wonder that satan desires to have you, that he may sift you as wheat. But fear not; <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    prays for you; your faith therefore shall not fail. How was <i>Paul</i> humbled and struck down before he was sent forth to preach the everlasting gospel? Prayer, temptation, and meditation, says <i>Luther</i>, are necessary ingredients for a minister. If <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    teaches us humility, it must be as <i>Gideon</i> taught the men of <i>Succoth</i>, by thorns. This I suppose is what dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    means; he has been conversant with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>,
    and writes much therefore in his way. I find he is for making thorough work of it, and digging deep in order to build high. He is certainly
    <a id="p246"></a>right; but why we should not press after and continually plead for assurance, which is every where through the holy scriptures spoken of as the common portion of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    children, I cannot yet see. It is a false humility to be content without that which <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    offers and promises to give. Let him give it in his own way and time; but, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    give me a full assurance of faith, that I may joy and rejoice in thee evermore!” should be the constant cry of your soul. My dear Sir, I could enlarge, but I must away to our good Lady <i>H――n</i>’s. You must not expect to see her till <i>August</i>. I preached at her Ladyship’s on <i>Thursday</i>, and am to do so weekly. I expect to leave town in about a month. Pray let me see you if possible. A new scene will open to you, now you begin to act publickly for <span

    but I must bid you farewel. Adieu. May the <span

    make us faithful <i>Nehemiahs</i>, for we have many <i>Sanballats</i> to deal with! but wherefore should we fear? If <span

      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    to write to strengthen the hands of one, who is not yet half your age, but I trust ready to spend and be spent for the good of precious and immortal souls. I see that you have heard how kind my enemies have been to me. They have told me of my faults, and by their opposition have given me an opportunity of confessing them. I am just now publishing a pamphlet, in answer to one published against the Methodists, upon the title-page of which I intend to have these words, “Out of the eater came forth meat.” O how good, how infinitely wise is <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>!
    How careful to cause all things to work together for good to those who love him. I have reason to speak well of him, as a promise-keeping Saviour. I doubt not, but he will greatly bless and own you in the latter stages of the road, and cause you to go off like a ripe shock of corn. It will rejoice you to hear that conviction work is going on in <i>England</i> and <i>Wales</i>. I believe the holy spirit is powerfully working on some of the Rich, and the Poor seem rather more eager than ever to hear the gospel. I am much engaged, so that I have scarce time to see or write to
    <a id="p248"></a>any; but in heaven there will be time enough, and but just enough too:</p>

At Lady <i>H――</i>’s request, I read part of it to some of the nobility, who approved of it very much. By your leave, I will put a sentence or two of it, without mentioning names, into a pamphlet I am now fitting for the press. I suppose you have seen it advertised. I want to own and publicly confess my public mistakes. O how many, how great have they been! How much obliged am I to my enemies for telling me of them! I wish you could see my pamphlet before it comes out. I just now wrote to Doctor <i>S――</i> to see if he cannot meet me this day sevennight, or contrive some way for conveyance of my little piece to him. O that it may be blessed to promote <span

    has given us a good passover, and that the prospect is still encouraging among the Rich. I intend leaving town in about a week, and to begin ranging after precious souls.—But I shall wait for the doctor’s answer. You judge right when you say, “it is your opinion that I do not want to make a sect, or set myself at the head of a party.” No, let the name of <i>Whitefield</i> die, so that the cause of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    may live. I have seen enough of popularity to be sick of it, and did not the interest of my blessed Master require my appearing in public, the world should hear but little of me henceforward. But who
    <a id="p249"></a>can desert such a cause? Who, for fear of a little contempt and suffering, would decline the service of such a Master? O that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    may thrust out many, many labourers into his harvest? Surely the time must come, when many of the priests also shall be obedient to the word. I wait for thy salvation, O <span

    I find myself now much better. Travelling, as usual, does me service, and the joy of the <span

I believe your Ladyship hath reason to say, “It is good for me, that I have been afflicted;”—and sanctified afflictions are undoubtedly signs of special love. To come purified out of the furnace, and to find that some of our dross is purged away by the <span

    putting us into the fire, is indeed an evidence that he is praying for us, and that our faith, however tried, shall not finally fail. O Madam, what a blessing is it to be able to say, “I know in whom I have believed!” How does such an assurance sweeten every bitter cup, and make even death itself to appear with an angel’s face! O that all who are destitute of this unspeakable gift, were convinced of their want thereof, and set upon hungering and thirsting after it! I hope your honoured sister will be one of these.

    that your Ladyship was better; and glad am I,
    <a id="p251"></a>yea very glad, that I can send your Ladyship good news from this part of the country. The night after I came here, I preached to many thousands, a great body of whom was attentive, but some of the baser sort made a little disturbance. A very great opposer sent for me to his house immediately, and could scarce refrain weeping all the time I was with him. On the <i>Friday</i> evening I preached at <i>Gosport</i>, where the mob has generally been very turbulent, but all was hushed and quiet, and as far as I could find, all approved. Every time the word has seemed to sink deeper and deeper into the people’s hearts, and their affections seem to be more and more drawn out. In short, I hope I can inform your Ladyship that <i>Portsmouth</i> is taken, and that we shall hear of many who will in earnest seek after the one thing needful. I have a great mind to go to the isle of <i>Wight</i>, but am not yet determined. Here is a knot of sincere souls, that seem to love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    in sincerity. Several date their awakenings from their hearing <i>T―― G――</i>, who I hear is to be ordained by the Bishop of <i>W――</i>, but I doubt it. Last night I had sweet conversation with two of the devout soldiers that have been abroad. They are soldiers indeed. Blessed be <span

    that there are so many of his children scattered up and down, who I trust will give him no rest, till he makes <i>Jerusalem</i> a praise through the whole earth. I do not forget Lady <i>F――</i>, the Countess, or any of those who seemed inclined to follow <span

    of <i>Nazareth</i>. O that they may be steady, and be enabled with full purpose of heart to cleave unto the <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span>T concerns me much, that one whom I so much honour, and so dearly love in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    should hear
    <a id="p252"></a>so seldom from me. Twice have I endeavoured to answer your last kind letter, but have been prevented, by want of health, a multiplicity of business, and frequent removes from place to place. About three weeks ago I was sent for up to <i>London</i> to see my wife, but she is not yet arrived. However, it has been over-ruled to the bringing me here, where I have been preaching every day for this week past, to very large and attentive auditories, who come to hear with great eagerness. I hear of many that are brought under convictions, prejudices seem to be universally removed, and a people that but a week ago were speaking all manner of evil against me, are now very desirous of my staying longer amongst them to preach the everlasting gospel. What cannot <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    do? After I remove hence, I purpose, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, to take a tour into <i>Wales</i>, where <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    tells me the work is upon the advance. We have lately renewed our connection, and whether I stay in <i>England</i> or go abroad, he and some more have agreed, in the strength of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    to continue preaching at the Tabernacle and elsewhere as formerly. At <i>London</i>, matters have advanced successfully. Real good has certainly been done among the Rich, and the Poor receive the gospel with as much gladness as ever. My outward embarrassments are much lessened, and I hope ere long to be able to say, “I owe no man any thing but love.” Many doors are open, and I have thoughts, if possible, of seeing <i>Scotland</i> this year. But at present I am in a strait, and continually saying, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    what wouldest thou have me to do?” Sometimes I think I must either drop my <i>English</i> or <i>American</i> work; but our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    knows best how to dispose of me. I would be as clay in his hands, and ready to go whithersoever he is pleased to call me. I should be glad to hear of a revival at <i>C――</i>; but, dear Sir, you have already seen such things as are seldom seen above once in a century. I am afraid that some good men’s calculations about the latter-day glory are premature, and that it is not so near at hand as some imagine. This is our comfort, a thousand years in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    sight are but as one day. He that comes, will come, and will not tarry. Take courage, my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>M――</i>;
    look up, and go on your way rejoicing. You will remember me most kindly to your dear yoke-fellow, <i>Nathaniel</i>, little <i>R――</i>, and the

    The end of all affliction, outward and inward, is to make us more and more partakers of a divine nature. The father of mercies hath dealt bountifully with your Ladyship; he hath blessed you in the decline of life. O that your latter end may greatly increase! May you be filled with all the fulness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    This, Madam, is the privilege of a real christian, always growing, and making perpetual advances in the divine life. The path of the just shines more and more unto the perfect day. The way, thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    your Ladyship knows. We must always come by faith, and be continually drawing out of the Redeemer’s inexhaustible fulness. If we are enabled to lean on him, we shall go comfortably on in a wilderness. That is the best name this world deserves. Cieled houses, gaudy attire, and rich furniture, do not make it appear less so to a mind truly enlightened to see the beauties that are in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    of <i>Nazareth</i>. These are things, which a watchful, well-informed christian will always look on with a jealous eye, lest they should divert him from looking unto <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    the author and finisher of his faith. But I need not
    <a id="p254"></a>write thus to your Ladyship, the native language of whose heart I trust is, “<span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    forbid that I should glory save in the cross of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” The preaching of the cross hath been much blessed here. Multitudes daily attend, and many are much affected. It would please your Ladyship to see the alteration that has been made in a week’s time. But what cannot <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    do? All things are possible to him. I hope your Ladyship will not forget a poor pilgrim in your prayers. Neither you nor your honoured sister are forgotten by him.

Gratitude constrains me to take the freedom, and the conviction I have that your Ladyship’s face is set <i>Zion</i>-wards, makes me think it will not be altogether unacceptable. With great pleasure I often reflect on that good work, which I trust the ever-blessed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has begun in your soul. My heart’s desire and continual prayer unto him is, that your Ladyship, having put your hand to the plough, may be kept from looking back! Satan will not be wanting to exert his utmost efforts to divert you from the cross. He knows of what influence your Ladyship’s example must necessarily be, and therefore will always be striving to persuade your Ladyship at least to compound matters, and to attempt to reconcile two irreconcilable differences, <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    and the world. But your Ladyship is too well grounded to hearken to his delusive insinuations, and too noble to refuse to give your whole heart to Him who has bought it
    <a id="p255"></a>with no less price than that of his own most precious blood.—What a price is now put into your Ladyship’s hands! What a glorious opportunity is now afforded you, to shew even before kings, that we are made kings indeed, and priests unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and that it is our privilege as christians to reign over sin, death, hell, the world, and ourselves, even whilst here on earth. Methinks I see angels gazing to see how your Ladyship acts your part. O that the angel of the everlasting covenant may always accompany you, and by the power of his eternal and all-conquering spirit, enable your Ladyship to fight the good fight of faith, and run with patience the glorious race that is set before you! He is never wanting to those that put their trust in him. Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, be always knocking, and a door of mercy shall be always opened unto you. O the happiness of a life wholly devoted to, and spent in communion and fellowship with the ever-blessed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    It is indeed heaven begun on earth. May your Ladyship taste of it more and more every day and every hour! Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I trust some in these parts, who a few days ago had never heard of, now begin to look after this kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    A more visible alteration I have not seen made in a people for some time. At first some of the baser sort made a noise, but ever since, thousands have attended in the greatest order, numbers have been and are affected, and through their importunity I have been prevailed on to stay longer than I designed. O to be instrumental to bring only one soul to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>!
    But whither am I running? Honoured Madam, your goodness will excuse this freedom. I believe your Ladyship will be glad to hear such tidings. It is the best way I can think of to express my gratitude for the many unmerited favours your Ladyship hath been pleased to confer on, honoured Madam,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH some degree of impatience have I been waiting to hear from your Ladyship, being very solicitous for your Ladyship’s welfare. This morning your Ladyship’s unexpected letter surprized me. I only expected to have a line from <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>C――</i>.
    Your Ladyship’s writing under such weakness, put me in mind of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>,
    who, when his friends advised him not to write on account of his illness, made this reply, “What! would you have my master come and find me idle?” Perhaps our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is fitting your Ladyship for some new work. <i>Luther</i> observed, that “he was never employed in any new thing, but he was beset with some temptations, or visited with a fit of sickness.” I only wish I could bear it for your Ladyship; but then your crown would not be so bright, nor the inward purity of your heart so great. The more trials when sanctified, the more conformed we shall be to the ever-loving ever-lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>. O that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords may water you every moment, and cause you to flourish like the burning bush unconsumed in fire! I have more good news to send your Ladyship from <i>Portsmouth</i>. Ever since my last, the prospect of doing good has increased. Thousands have attended, and even when it rained, when one could reasonably expect but very few, some thousands came to hear the word. I have contracted a cold by preaching in the rain; but what is that, if any soul can but get good!</p>

    caused the word to leave a blessing behind it. Yesterday, congregations were very large in the fields. This evening I am to preach again, and to-morrow, <span

      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is only purging you that you may bring forth more fruit. I am always thinking of, and praying for your Ladyship’s perfect recovery. I am now reduced to great weakness myself, but the joy of the <span

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH I suppose your Ladyship will not be at <i>Bristol</i> so soon as this reaches it, yet as this is the most leisure time I am likely to have these three weeks, I cannot help writing a few lines to wait for your Ladyship at my brother’s house. I think (as I am persuaded he does also) that he is highly honoured in having your Ladyship under his roof, and I earnestly pray the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords to bless the waters, for the recovery of your health. Though I want to die myself, yet methinks I would have others live, especially such as, like your Ladyship, are placed upon a pinnacle, and in a particular manner set up as lights in the world. For two days past I have been at my wife’s house for the sake of a little retirement. It has been sweet, yea very sweet, so sweet that I should be glad never to be heard of again. But this must not be. A necessity is laid upon me, and woe is me if I do not preach the gospel of <span

    fill you with all his fulness, and after you have done and suffered what he hath appointed for you here, translate you to partake of an exceeding and eternal weight of glory in his kingdom hereafter. So prays, honoured Madam,</p>

  <p>
    <i>My very dear Brother</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span>NCLOSED you have a letter for our good Lady <i>H――</i>, whom I suppose you will have the honour of receiving in
    <a id="p259"></a>a few days under your roof. Both before, and ever since I left <i>Bristol</i>, I have been frequently thinking of the unspeakable mercies, that the infinitely great and glorious <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is pleased to pour down upon us.—Surely the language of both our hearts ought to be, “What shall we render unto the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?”
    For my part, I am lost in wonder, and want a thousand lives to spend in the Redeemer’s service. O let not my dear brother be angry, if I intreat him at length to leave off killing, and begin to redeem time. A concern for your eternal welfare so affects me, that it often brings bodily sickness upon me, and drives me to a throne of grace, to wrestle in your behalf. Even now, whilst I am writing, my soul is agonizing in prayer for you, hoping I shall see that day, when you will have poured out on you a spirit of grace and of supplication, and look to him whom we have pierced, and be made to mourn as one mourneth for a first-born. Till this be done, all resolutions, all schemes for amendment, will be only like spiders webs. Nature is a mere Proteus, and till renewed by the spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    though it may shift its scene, will be only nature still. Apply then, my dearest Brother, to the fountain of light and life, from whence every good and perfect gift cometh. A worthy woman in all probability is going to throw herself under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    into your hands. A considerable addition will be then made to your present talents, and consequently a greater share of care and circumspection necessary to improve all for the glory of Him, who hath been always preventing and following you with his blessings. Should you prove any otherwise than a pious husband, it will be one of the greatest afflictions I ever met with in my life. At present you can only hurt yourself, which is hurt enough; but then (forgive me, my dear Brother,) I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. My fears shall be turned into prayers, and I will follow this letter with strong crying unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in your behalf. My retirement here these two days hath been very sweet; but to-morrow I begin a three weeks circuit. Next sabbath I am to be at <i>Carmarthen</i>, the <i>Friday</i> following at <i>Haverford-west</i>. For the present, adieu. That you may take <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    to be your All in All, and that the remainder of your life may be one continued sacrifice of love to him, who hath
    <a id="p260"></a>shed his precious blood for you, is the hearty prayer of, my dear Brother,</p>

    for your recovery from your late indisposition. Many of <span

    almoner is no mean office. You shall be rewarded ere long before men and angels. <abbr

To-morrow I set out on a three weeks circuit through <i>Wales</i>. I have been here these two days for a little retirement: it has been very sweet. On <i>Thursday</i> I saw <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>E―― I――</i>,
    the dissenting minister I before spoke of, and found him very meanly apparelled. He is a most worthy man, and from his zeal for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    some time ago, he sold fifteen pounds worth of his books to finish a small Meeting-house in which he preaches. He has but three pounds per annum from the fund, and about as much from his people. He lives very low, but enjoys much of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and hath as great understanding in the figurative parts of scripture as any one I know of in the world. He is a <i>Zachary</i>, and his wife an <i>Elizabeth</i>. Four or five guineas might be bestowed on them. What a scene will open at the great day!
    <a id="p261"></a>How many <i>rich Priests</i> will stand confounded, whilst the poor despised <i>faithful Ministers</i> of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    shall enter, after all their tribulation, into the joy of their <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    I tremble for the one, I rejoice in the foresight of the happiness of the other. May my latter end and future state (however I may be disposed of in the mean while) be like theirs! I know you will say, <i>Amen</i>. But what am I doing? I am robbing the poor of your time. Away to your work in the strength of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and whilst you are feeding others, may the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    feast your soul! My heartiest respects attend <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">A</span>S I have a peculiar love for you and your wife, I need not inform you that your letter, which gave me an account of her great illness, affected me much. I have not failed to remember her at the throne of grace, and I trust this will find her either relieved from her pain, or resigned to his will who orders all things well. Parting is hard to those who, like you two, have walked in love. But we can do all things through <span

    the gospel runs and is glorified! I have been enabled to preach fourteen times within these eight days, and the word has every where fallen with weight and power. Yesterday was a great day here indeed. This morning I am going toward <i>Haverford-west</i>, and am to be at <i>Abergavenny</i> to-morrow fortnight.

    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE my coming into <i>Wales</i>, and leaving <i>Carmarthen</i>, the infinitely great and infinitely condescending Redeemer has been pleased to ride on in the chariot of the everlasting gospel. Congregations grow larger and larger, and all the towns here about are quite open for the word of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Yesterday I preached very near <i>Pembroke</i>, to-day and next <span

I wish I had more time in these parts. The fields are indeed white, ready unto harvest, and the young men bred up at <i>Carmarthen</i> Academy were much taken. The congregations consist of many thousands, and their behaviour is very affecting. Indeed we have blessed seasons. O free grace! Here is a dear young man, just ripe for orders. He has good parts, and hath made some proficiency in the languages, is solid, and of some influence in this town. He can get testimonials, and if ordained I believe would be eminently useful in the church. I wish a way could be found out for his admission: but I fear it is impracticable. However, I thought it my duty just to hint it to your Ladyship. May the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls find out means for sending him, and many more like-minded, into his vineyard! But how is your Ladyship’s health? I begin to be quite uneasy, because I have received no letter from my brother.

    <i>Landovery, June 14, 1749.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span> Few days ago, I received a letter from <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>,
    in which yours to him dated <i>May</i> <abbr
      title="twentieth">20th</abbr>
    was inclosed. It gave me some concern, and would have given me more had not the same letter informed me that good Lady <i>H――n</i> had written to you herself. Alas, my dear friend, what needless trouble do you give yourself, and into what difficulties does your fear of man, your too great attachment to the world, and an over-weening fondness for your pretty character, every day bring you! Is it not time to drop our correspondence, when, on so slight an information, you could so much as suspect that I had betrayed that confidence you reposed in me, or believe that I read a letter wherein you declared yourself a <i>Methodist</i>, when I had never such letter from you. The only passage, as far as I can remember, that was read (and that too at my Lady’s request, if I mistake not) was that noble one wherein you said, “Let the world take my character, and tear it to pieces, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>”
    Are you ashamed, my dear friend, of the resolution? Or think you to put that in practice, and shun being called a <i>Methodist</i>? You might as well attempt to reach heaven with your hand; for, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    such an honour has he put upon the Methodists, that whoever renounces the world and takes up <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    cross, and believes and lives the doctrines of Grace, must be stiled a Methodist whether he will or not. Formerly it was “You are a Puritan,” now it is, “You are a Methodist.” And why does my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    take such pains to declare, he never will join the Methodists? Who ever asked him? Or what service could you do their cause by joining, unless your heart was more enstranged from the world than at present it is? Would to <span
      class="smcap">God</span> you was more like-minded with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>!
    He seems to have set down, and counted the cost. He seems to have begun at the right end, and to be fully convinced that there is no reconciling <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    <a id="p264"></a>and the world, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and <i>Mammon</i>. My dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>,
    suffer me to be free with you. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    I trust has begun a good work in your soul: but indeed you have many lessons yet to learn. The great physician must give many a bitter portion, in order to purge out the opinion you have of your own importance, and the too great desire you have to keep in with the world. Reproach you cannot shun, if you appear but a little for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>;
    and you will not have more, perhaps not so much, if you shew quite out. Perhaps you may say, I have done this already; do not then be ashamed of it, but go on, grow in grace, press forwards, and then I care not what declaration you make of your not intending to be a <i>Methodist</i>. Be a consistent christian, live above the world, call not the fear of man christian prudence, and then underneath you shall be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    everlasting arms. Thanks be to his great name, they have upholden me for some weeks last past. I have now been a circuit of several hundred miles. At <i>Portsmouth</i> and <i>Gosport</i> the word ran and was glorified. In <i>South Wales</i> every where the fields have been white ready unto harvest. Not a dog stirs his tongue. Last <i>Sunday</i> I believe I preached to near twenty thousand souls. Grace! grace! In about ten days I hope to be at <i>Bristol</i>. Soon after I propose to go to <i>London</i>, and from thence to <i>Yorkshire</i> and <i>Scotland</i>.—Follow me with your prayers, and in return you shall be remembered by, very dear Sir,</p>

    gave me both pleasure and pain. I was pleased to read the sweet observations made up and down in it, but pained to find that you have been much indisposed. But what says our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?
    “Those that abide in him, he will purge;” but it is only in order that they may bring forth more fruit. Perhaps our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is about to employ you in some fresh work. I wish you may be enabled to draw your pen on the topic you mentioned; it may be of great service to the church of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    Your remark upon
    <a id="p265"></a>my pamphlet is just. I wrote short, because I know long compositions generally weary the reader. Perhaps hereafter I may write more; but at present I find I have enough to do, to travel, and preach, and answer my correspondents. I published my confession of some mistakes and imprudencies, to satisfy my own conscience, and stop the mouths of adversaries, and strengthen the hands of real disinterested hearty friends: but where are such friends to be found? That phantom called <i>Contempt</i> keeps them in fetters, and makes them afraid to appear in defence of a cause, which, (notwithstanding the many imprudencies that have attended it) is undoubtedly the cause of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    If we think to be free from these, in this imperfect state of things, and to see either a perfect saint or a perfect church till we come to heaven, we shall find ourselves much mistaken. Daily experience, and more mature consideration, may lessen our blunders and imperfections; but death alone will put a final stop to their mixing in all we do. Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span> that we have a <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    who amidst all does love, and can uphold us. If our infirmities lead us to his cross, and our sufferings only make us more willing to be conformed to him in his death, we are gainers by all our losses, and rise by all our falls. Blessed be the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    that you, dear Sir, have had grace given you to sit down and count the cost. I wish the beloved physician was more reconciled to the cross. I am persuaded, let him say what he pleases, that a too great attachment to the world makes him reason as he does in many things. Well,—he is in good hands. He must either come or be dragged to the cross. That pretty character of his must be crucified and slain: and as well as others, he must be content (as <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Gurnall</i>
    expresses it) “to go to heaven in a fool’s coat.” O my dear Sir, what pains is the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    obliged to take with us, before we can be reconciled to suffer shame for his great name’s sake!</p>

    Thus far I wrote, but was obliged to stop, being called out to preach. Yesterday <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    brought me here, after having carried me a circuit of about eight hundred miles, and enabled me to preach, I suppose to upwards of a hundred thousand souls. I have been in eight <i>Welch</i> counties, and I think we have not had one dry meeting. The work in <i>Wales</i> is
    <a id="p266"></a>much upon the advance, and likely to increase daily. Had my dear <abbr

    been there to have seen the simplicity of so many dear souls, I am persuaded he would have said, “<i
      lang="la">Sit anima mea cum Methodistis!</i>”
    But every one to his post. During this excursion I have been kept happy inwardly, and well in body till the latter end of last week, when the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was pleased to lay his hand upon me, so that I was almost brought to the grave. But he that wounds, heals also. Thanks be to his holy name for ever and ever! On <i>Monday</i> or <i>Tuesday</i> next, <span
      class="smcap">God</span> willing,
    I set out for <i>London</i>. Good Lady <i>H――</i> is here, and goes on in her usual way, doing good. She is recovered from her indisposition. I hope this will find you recovered also. That the <span

    it found me as well as can be expected in my body, and I trust steady in promoting the welfare of precious and immortal souls. I have lately seen great things in <i>Wales</i>, and the seed sown among the Rich, has in some sprung up and brought forth fruit; but what you have heard from <i>Scotland</i> is all a mistake.

The author of it is my old friend; a most heavenly-minded creature, one of the first of the Methodists, who is contented with a small cure, and gives all that he has to the poor. He is very weak, and daily waits for his dissolution. A neighbouring clergyman near him preaches the gospel; and a physician, formerly a noted Deist, has lately espoused the interest of <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Am obliged to you for your kind letters; for the trouble you have been at about the money, and for all favours. Was I to follow my own inclinations, I would come and thank you in person; but I fear providence will not permit me to embark for <i>America</i> this fall. However, I am looking up, and looking about me, and trust our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will point out his way before me. I am not at all uneasy at what one of your clergy may have said of me; I am only sorry upon his own account; having known more than once, that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    delights to plead the cause of the injured. I trust I can say, that with simplicity and godly sincerity I desire to have my conversation in the world; and I hope it is my daily study to keep a conscience void of offence towards <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and towards man. Whilst this is the case, we need not fear what men or devils can say, or do unto us. They can only speak all manner of evil against us falsely: and that our <span

    hath taught us to expect. They can only kill the body; blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, the
    <a id="p268"></a>soul is out of their reach. I am content to wait till the day of judgment for the clearing up of my character: and after I am dead, I desire no other epitaph than this, “Here lies <i>G. W.</i> what sort of a man he was, the great day will discover.” O my dear Sir, what a blessed thing is it to have the Redeemer to be our friend. If we can but truly say, “I know that my Redeemer liveth,” how safely may we put our souls into his hands, as into the hands of a faithful creator! I hope my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>D――</i>
    will not rest till he can say so.—The frequent indispositions of body that you are under, are so many loud calls to prepare for another world.—Nothing but the righteousness of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span> imputed, and the holiness of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    imparted to your soul, can make you happy in a dying hour. I could enlarge, but must away. With this, I have sent you a dozen of my nine sermons, to be disposed of as you think best. I would send more, but have very few left. I would write to Esquire <i>R――</i>, and some other gentlemen, but have not the least leisure. Be pleased to remember me to them in the kindest manner, as they come in your way, and let them know they are not forgotten by me. Will your dear yoke-fellow, and all your family, accept of my hearty love? I owe you much. May the <span

    reward you a thousand-fold! He will, he will. Last night <abbr

They come to inform you, that you never are, and, by divine assistance, never shall be forgotten by me at the
    <a id="p269"></a>throne of grace. To that, I trust, your Ladyship finds free access every day, and every hour, through the blood of the Lamb, who was slain to take away the sins of the world. Your Ladyship’s present situation, I hope, will be sanctified to this end. It is in the school of affliction that we must learn the way to, and reap benefit from the cross.—Happy they who come purified out of the furnace, and, like the burning bush, flourish unconsumed in fire. This, Madam, is the privilege of all believers. Trials, which harden others, purify and soften them. The love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    turns every thing into what is more valuable than gold. It brings light out of darkness, and causes others blindness to increase our spiritual sight. O glorious privilege! happy change! How much are you indebted, honoured Madam, to free grace, for making you in any degree a partaker of it! Alas! alas! but few of your Ladyship’s station in life choose to strive to enter into that strait gate which leadeth unto life eternal. The noise of coaches, and the continual attention to what they call innocent diversions, drowns the small still voice of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    blessed Spirit speaking in their hearts. Since I have been here, many in high life have attended; whether to any valuable purpose, the great day will discover. Good Lady <i>H――n</i> still continues to abound in the work of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    and is brightening her crown every day and hour. She is quite well, and intends staying some days longer for the benefit of the waters. Your Ladyship is remembered when we are feasting at the Redeemer’s table. In a few days I shall move hence; and it may be, that I shall go to <i>Georgia</i> this fall. May the <span

Only, my dear friend, take this caution, “sit down, and count the cost, before you begin to build.” Do not lay out more than you know you can pay. Go the cheapest way to work; and if you cannot build, rather keep a stock in hand to pay the schoolmaster, and hire a house convenient from year to year, and, if possible, find the children in books.

This comes, therefore, to beg the favour of your Lordship, only to let me know, (in whatever manner your Lordship shall judge most proper) upon what foundation such a charge is built: and I hereby promise, by divine assistance, that a full, fair, and explicit answer shall be given to your Lordship, by, my Lord,</p>

    <i>My Lord</i>,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Thank your Lordship for your kind and cordial letter. I shall take care to do your Lordship justice, by shewing it to such persons as I think have been more immediately concerned. This, I imagine, will be as much satisfaction as your Lordship will desire. I suppose the mistake has lain here: your Lordship might have insinuated, that by my present way of acting, I had broken the solemn engagement I had entered into at my ordination: and that might have been interpreted to imply a charge of <i>Perjury</i>. The relation in which I stand to the Right Honourable the Countess of <i>H――</i>, made me desirous to clear myself from such an imputation; and at the same time to give your Lordship an opportunity of vindicating yourself in the manner you have done. Was I not afraid of intruding too much upon your Lordship’s time, and of shewing the least inclination to controversy, I would endeavour, in the fear of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    to answer the other part of your Lordship’s letter; and, as far as lies in me, give your Lordship a satisfactory account of whatever may seem irregular and exceptionable in my present conduct. This I would be glad to do, not only before your Lordship, but all the Right Reverend the Bishops; for I highly honour them on account of the sacred character they sustain, and would make it my daily endeavour to obey all their godly admonitions. This, I presume, my Lord, is the utmost extent of the promise I made at my ordination. If I err or deviate from this, in any respect, it is through ignorance and want of better information, and not (as far as I
    <a id="p272"></a>know my own heart) but of obstinacy or contempt of lawful authority. But I forget myself. I beg your Lordship’s pardon for taking up so much of your time; I thank your Lordship for your prayers in my behalf; and beg leave to offer mine in return for your Lordship’s present and eternal welfare, who am, my Lord,</p>

    I came yesterday in the afternoon. Several, I find, were awakened when I was here last; and the fields are every where white, ready unto harvest. My late pamphlet has been greatly blest. My Lord of <i>Exeter</i> was asked, Whether he had seen it? He answered, “Yes,” and said, “I wrote like an honest man, had recanted several things, but he goes on in the same way yet.” Being asked, Whether he did not intend publishing his second part? he replied, “You may expect a second.” <span

I rejoice that so much gospel seed has been sown in <i>Yorkshire</i>, and that so much hath sprung up and brought forth fruit. No wonder that the enemy has been busy to sow tares of various kinds amongst it. This always was, and, in all probability, will always be the case, till time shall be no more.

The beginning of next month, I have thoughts of being your way. If it is best, providence will direct my course thither. In the mean while, and at all other seasons, whether I come or not,

His preface to me is most virulent. Every thing I wrote in my answer, is turned into the vilest ridicule, and nothing will satisfy, but giving up the glorious work of the ever-blessed <span

    as entirely cheat and imposture. I cannot see that it calls for any further answer from me. <abbr

The glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> has given me several spiritual children in this place, who do indeed adorn the gospel of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    their Saviour. Here is a little flock, to whom, I believe, it will be our heavenly Father’s good pleasure to give an eternal kingdom. I have preached once publicly to a large auditory, and this evening am to preach again. I am ashamed I do no more for Him, who hath done and suffered so much for me. O what shall I render unto the <span

    of all lords, whose mercy endureth for ever! A thought of his infinite patience and long-suffering strikes me dumb. His goodness, in bringing me into the acquaintance of your Ladyship, quite amazes me; and the many peculiar providences that have attended me this last year, encourage me to believe that goodness and mercy shall follow
    <a id="p276"></a>me all the days of my life, and that I shall dwell in the house of the <span

Since I have been in the <i>West</i>, I have been preaching as usual, and a divine influence hath every where attended the word. This, I think, is the best way to answer those that oppose themselves.

Here I came last night, after having preached the everlasting gospel to many thousands in the <i>West</i>. Sometimes I have been weak in body; but He, whose I am, and whom I endeavour to serve in the gospel of his dear Son, hath carried me through, and greatly refreshed and comforted my soul. Alas! to what a heaven are they strangers, who deny the influence of the Blessed Spirit, and cry down the felt and abiding joys of the Holy Ghost, as fancy, enthusiasm, and delusion. Ye poor dry Rationalists! I honour your parts in other respects, but pity your ignorance in the things of <span

    By this time, I suppose your Ladyship hath seen the Bishop’s second performance. I think it is an original, and so very scurrilous, unchristian, and profane, that I cannot think it will be worth my while to answer him again. I have satisfied my conscience in publishing my last pamphlet; and I now commit our cause to him who judgeth righteously. O honoured Madam, what a happy thing is it to be despised for the sake of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>!
    When <i>John Huss</i> was burnt, the Bishop of <i>Constance</i> painted devils upon paper, and put them round his head; how soon were they exchanged for a crown of glory! Yet a little
    <a id="p278"></a>while, and He that cometh will come, and will not tarry. Till then, may your Ladyship be kept by the mighty power of <span

      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    evidence to the world, that you are indeed experimentally acquainted with the power of his resurrection. High is your station, great are your difficulties; but he that dwelleth on high is mightier, and hath engaged to make you more than conqueror through his love.

    <span class="dropcap">B</span>Y the providence of good and gracious <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I came to town on <i>Thursday</i> evening, after having had a pleasant circuit in the <i>West</i>. The day after I wrote to your Ladyship, I preached twice at <i>Exeter</i>, and in the evening I believe I had near ten thousand hearers. The Bishop and several of his clergy stood very near me, as I am informed. A good season it was. All was quiet, and there was a great solemnity in the congregation; but a drunken man threw at me three great stones. One of them cut my head deeply, and was like to knock me off the table; but, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I was not discomposed at all. One of the other stones struck a poor man quite down. As I came from <i>Exeter</i>, I visited one <i>John Hayne</i>, the soldier that, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    begun the great awakening in <i>Flanders</i>. He is in <i>Dorchester</i> <a
      id="p278b" href="#n_15">♦</a>gaol
    for preaching at <i>Shaftsbury</i>, where there has been, and is now a great awakening. Every where the work is upon the spread; and since I have been here, we have had some of the most awful, solemn, powerful meetings, as I ever saw at the Tabernacle. Congregations have been very large, and I have had several meetings with the preachers. On <i>Saturday</i> I had the honour
    <a id="p279"></a>of being almost all the day long with Lady <i>F――</i>, Lady <i>H――</i>, Lady <i>C――</i>, and the Countess of <i>D――</i>. Lady <i>F――</i> and the Countess received the blessed sacrament before the others came: and I think they both grow. If I stay over <i>Sunday</i>, (as perhaps I may) I hope to have another day with them. I am sorry to inform your Ladyship, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>D――</i>
    died last <i>Sunday</i> about noon. He had been sick about a fortnight, was in doubts for a while, but two or three days before his death he rejoiced in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    his Saviour. This morning I had the pleasure of a visit from <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i>
    and two <i>German</i> ministers, who have been labouring among the <i>Jews</i>, and been made instrumental of converting many of them. They seemed to be dear souls. They have preached at the <i>German</i> chapel with great power. That your Ladyship may always enjoy a thriving soul in a healthy body, is the continual prayer of, honoured Madam,</p>

The account of your temporal affairs, which I received from my wife, gave me great concern. I often wish it was in my power to assist you; but as it is not, all I can do is to pray for you, and exhort you to look up to Him, who has engaged, that all things shall work together for good to those who love him in sincerity. This, I am persuaded, may be said of you; and therefore, dear Sir, be of good courage. These light afflictions are but for a moment, and are intended to work out a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Thanks be to <span

    all the hell we are to have, is on this side the grave; there is none for believers beyond it: and even in the midst of our deepest temporal misery, we may enjoy an antepast of heaven. This you know by experience. Thanks be to <span

Upon reading it, I felt all the springs of sympathy move as it were at once. Glad would I have been of the wings of a dove, to have fled to, and condoled with my suffering friend. Perhaps I have heard from what corner your cross comes. It is a very near one indeed.—A saying of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    hath often comforted me; “I would often have nestled, but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    always put a thorn in my nest.” Is not this suffered, my dear brother, think you, to prick you out, and to compel you as it were to appear for the <span

    Preaching is my grand <i>Catholicon</i> under all domestic, as well as other trials. Methinks the voice of providence now is, “Who is on the <span

    <a id="p281"></a>out a flamer at last. O when shall this once be! who would lose one moment? Amazing! that the followers of a crucified Redeemer should be afraid of contempt. Surely it must be for want of looking more to, and considering him who endured so much pain, and despised so much shame, but is now sitting at the right hand of the throne of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>. <i

    Excuse this freedom, I write out of the fulness of my heart, not to draw you over to me or a party, but to excite you to appear openly for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I am glad you intend to write. May I know the plan you intend to go upon? Do you think to say any thing to the Bishop of <i>Exeter</i>? Have you seen his second piece? Would you have me reply? Will you point out to me the faults of my first answer? A letter may be directed (if you write immediately) to be left for me at the Reverend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>J――</i>’s,
    <i>Yorkshire</i>. Thither I am bound now, and if the season of the year should permit, I would stretch to <i>Scotland</i>. Alas, how soon is the year gone round since I was there last! and how little have I done for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>!
    A thought of it sometimes breaks my heart. And yet how good is the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>!
    In <i>London</i> we have had most delightful seasons. The glory of the Redeemer filled the tabernacle. If any doubt whether the cause we are embarked in be the cause of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I say, “Come and see.” Are you free that I should call upon you in my return to town? I think to come by way of <i>Northampton</i>. You shall hear what is done in <i>Yorkshire</i>. I find <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has blessed my preaching at <i>Oundle</i> to some souls. At <i>Biddiford</i>, <i>Plymouth</i>, <i>Exeter</i>, and <i>Chatham</i> the word ran and was glorified. But what am I doing? I never wrote to any one so freely, I think, that I was not personally acquainted with, as to you.

    willing, we set out for <i>Leeds</i>, and after about a week’s stay in those parts I intend returning to <i>London</i>. As it is so late in the year, my <i>Scotch</i> friends advise me to defer my going thither. Had I known that, I should have embarked for <i>America</i> this fall; but I find there were other reasons for my being prevented crossing the waters this winter. I desire to follow the Lamb whithersoever he is pleased to lead me. At <i>New-haven</i> there is a great awakening. If any thing offers worthy of notice, your Ladyship shall be sure to hear. In the mean while, I continue to put up my usual prayer, that your Ladyship may be filled with all the fulness of <span

    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">S</span>OME time last week, my wife sent me the letter your Ladyship was pleased to favour me with about three weeks ago. Though I was sorry it did not reach me before I left town, yet I rejoiced to find that it bespoke your Ladyship’s attachment to the ever-loving ever-lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and a desire to partake of the sacred symbols of his most blessed body and blood. I doubt not but your Ladyship, with full purpose of heart, will cleave unto him, and in spite of men and devils go on in that narrow way which leads to life eternal. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    grace will be sufficient for you. He hath promised, and he is faithful who hath promised, never to leave nor forsake those that put their trust in him. He is in the burning bush, he is in the fiery furnace. He can and will make us more than conquerors over all. With what courage then may your Ladyship go on through this howling wilderness, whilst leaning on your beloved Saviour? In him alone is all your strength found. Honoured Madam, look to him, consider him, and thereby you will be kept from being weary and faint in your mind. I doubt not but you meet with daily crosses. Persons that stand alone, and in high places, must expect storms. But <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is able and willing to uphold you. Thanks be to his great name for giving your Ladyship such a share of prudence and courage. May the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> increase both; and without being attached to any party, may you be preserved unspotted from the world, and be a common friend to all!—Since I saw your Ladyship, I have disengaged myself from the immediate care of the societies, and am now still more at liberty to preach the gospel of the blessed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    A series of unforeseen providences brought me down this way. In <i>Yorkshire</i> many, many thousands have attended the word, and here at <i>Newcastle</i> thousands also hear the gospel gladly. To-morrow I am returning back, and hope to be in town some time this month. I fear it is now too late to embark for <i>America</i> this winter; but,
    <a id="p285"></a>thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I hear my family is well, and that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath given them a plentiful crop. If your Ladyship lives, I believe you will hear of some souls being educated at <i>Georgia</i> for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Honoured Madam, my heart’s desire and constant prayer is, that you may go on from strength to strength, and be continually growing in the knowledge of yourself and <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> your <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    I must now add no more, but my repeated thanks for all your Ladyship’s favours, and my repeated assurances of being, honoured Madam,</p>

    <i>To Lady F―― S――.</i></p>
  <p class="quobrk align_rt">
    <i>Estwood in Lancashire, <abbr
      title="October">Oct.</abbr> 25, 1749.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE I had the honour of writing to your Ladyship from <i>Newcastle</i>, fresh wonders of grace and mercy have been shewn us daily. I have now I think preached about thirty times in <i>Yorkshire</i>, and above ten times in <i>Cheshire</i>, and <i>Lancashire</i>. Congregations have been very large, and a solid, convincing, and comforting influence hath every where attended the word. In one or two places I have had a little rough treatment, but elsewhere all has been quiet, and many I hear are brought under concern about the welfare of their better part. At the importunity of many, I am now returning from <i>Manchester</i> (where I preached to many thousands) to <i>Leeds</i>; from thence I purpose going to <i>Sheffield</i>, and next week I hope to see good Lady <i>H――n</i> at <i>Ashby</i>, and the week following I hope to be in <i>London</i>. Thus do I lead a pilgrim life: <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    give me a pilgrim heart, and enable me to speak of redeeming love to a lost world, till I can speak no more! Surely this is a work that brings with it its own reward. It brings a heaven into the soul, and causes it, amidst all the scoffs and tauntings of a benighted, ill-natured, and ridiculing world, to rejoice with joy unspeakable, even a joy that is full of glory. “To me, (says the blessed apostle) to live is <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.”
    When a person can once say so in reality, then he begins to live indeed. Even death itself is then life, because death to such a one is
    <a id="p286"></a>eternal gain. O how great, how striking, how transporting and transforming are the invisible realities of another world, to a soul that is born of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    What meer shadows and empty nothings are all sublunary enjoyments, when compared with these! Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who has given you, honoured Madam, a taste of these infinitely important things. My constant prayer for your Ladyship is, that you may hold on, and hold out, and with full purpose of heart cleave unto that Redeemer who hath loved you, and given himself for you. <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>G――</i>
    at <i>Manchester</i> goes on well, and is not ashamed to confess him, who I trust has called her out of darkness, and made her partaker of his marvellous light. May the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> add daily to the number of his honourable confessors, and give the rich to know, that to be rich in faith and good works is the only way to be rich indeed! All is ours, if we can truly say, we are <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s.
    Honoured Madam, I must beg your excuse for this freedom; but at present I have a view of the Redeemer’s glory, and therefore know not well how to stop when writing of him. Your Ladyship will <a
      id="p286b" href="#n_34">♦</a>pardon
    me, and accept these poor lines, which shall be followed with hearty prayers from, honoured Madam,</p>

    I am constrained as it were to write to your Ladyship. Will it not rejoice you very much, honoured Madam, to hear the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> is riding on in the chariot of his gospel, from conquering to conquer? Every day people flock to hear the word, like doves to their windows. I have preached about thirty times in <i>Yorkshire</i>, and at the desire of many am returned thither again. The latter end of next week I hope to see good Lady <i>H――n</i>. I suppose her Ladyship will detain me a
    <a id="p287"></a>few days at <i>Ashby</i>, and then I purpose coming directly to <i>London</i>. Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    all places are near alike to me, so that I can but be doing something for Him, who hath done and suffered so much for me. This I would have to be my meat and my drink. To me to live, let it be <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>;
    for life is no further desirable than as we can improve it to the promoting his glory. <i>Mary</i> thought so, who in the days of his flesh sat at the Redeemer’s feet and heard his words. This I believe is your Ladyship’s daily employ; a glorious employ indeed. How sweet must his fruit be unto your Ladyship’s taste! Surely it is sweeter than the honey or the honeycomb. And if the first-fruits are so delightful, how infinitely delightful must the full harvest be! Go on, honoured Madam, and whatever others may do, still keep pursuing after more and more of that better part, which shall never be taken away from you. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is full of grace, and full of truth. Believers are welcome to him every moment. He is ready to water them continually with the dew of his heavenly blessing. It is our privilege to go on from grace to grace, till grace be swallowed up in endless glory. O that your honoured sister may march on with your Ladyship towards this blessed state! There she will have a house, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. I send her Ladyship my most dutiful respects, and sincerely pray that she may be filled with all the fulness of <span

    <a id="p288"></a>I am persuaded she will comply. She seems to be quite in earnest. I conversed for about two hours with the Captain and some other officers, upon the nature and necessity of the new birth. He was affected, and I hope it was blessed. Since I left them, I have preached to many thousands at <i>Rosindale</i>, <i>Aywood</i>, and <i>Halifax</i>. I have also offered <span

    <i>Pudsy</i>, and <i>Armly</i>, and have had three precious seasons here. Congregations are exceeding large indeed, and both the established and dissenting clergy are very angry.

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Thank you heartily for your kind letter to me, and your kind benefaction to poor <abbr

      class="smcap">God</span>,
    whom you both serve, will plentifully reward and bless you. I am in great hopes, enough will be raised to pay his debts, and that a provision will be made for his future subsistence. Rather than <i>Elijahs</i> shall want, ravens shall be sent to feed
    <a id="p289"></a>them. Your present circumstances almost distress me, and at the same time make me ashamed. I think it requires more grace heartily to say, “Father, thy will be done,” in such a situation, than to die a martyr forty times. But my dear friend, though your body is weak and confined at home, your pen hath been active, and your works walk abroad. I hear of them from all quarters. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    hath blessed, and will bless them. Let that comfort you, and if health any way permits, pray write again. Fear not, my dear dear Man; let faith and patience hold out a little longer, and then the struggle shall be over. Yet a little while, and you shall join with that sweet singer <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> <i>Watts</i>,
    who whilst on earth dragged a crazy load along, as well as you, for many years. As for my poor tabernacle, I wonder it is not dissolved every day; but we are immortal till our work is done. Now is my time for doing; my suffering time may come by and by. O for strength in a trying hour! Wherefore should we fear? Wherefore should we doubt? He that hath loved us, will love us to the end. This encourages me to hold on my way. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I have seen great things since I wrote last. The fields have been more and more white, ready unto harvest. I am now at <i>Ashby</i> with good Lady <i>H――n</i>. Her Ladyship has a great regard for you, and begs you would come and stay a week at her house. She will take great care of you. I think to remove hence on <i>Monday</i>, and should be very glad to see you in my way to <i>London</i>. However this be, we shall meet in heaven. There the wicked heart and wicked world will cease from troubling, and there the weary will enjoy an uninterrupted and eternal rest. This morning we have been remembering our blessed Redeemer’s death, and I was enabled to pray earnestly for my dear <abbr

    I beseech the Father of mercies and <span

    would give you to see of the travel of his soul, in the salvation of many at <i>Ashby</i>. I am persuaded your Ladyship was not sent there for nothing.—But it is always darkest before break of day. I desire to be thankful that your honoured Sisters are pleased to approve of me. Thanks be to <span

    I feel myself unworthy; but unworthy as I am, my poor prayers I trust will reach heaven in their behalf. This day, both they and your Ladyship were remembered at the <span

    table. The Countess, Lady <i>G――</i> and Lady <i>F――</i> were there, and all I think are grown in grace and in the knowledge of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> and Saviour <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    What encouragement is this for your Ladyship to go and speak for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>?
    All send their best compliments, and Lady <i>F――</i> desired me to inform your Ladyship, that the man who was sent up has been taken care of. Blessed be <span

    for putting it in your Ladyship’s power to help the poor sufferers of <i>Cork</i>. Last night I received a letter from <abbr

      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    I believe is at his house. I pity those who have been persecuted in <i>Ireland</i>. The minister being taken so ill near your Ladyship, was an alarming providence. But who so blind as those that will not see? <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    honours your Ladyship, in making you instrumental to own and provide for those, who are cast out for his great name’s sake. Great shall be your reward in heaven. I hope you and your honoured sisters will have great comfort in the perseverance of the poor baker. He is a <i>Jerusalem</i> sinner, a proper object for free grace to fix on. A woman of fourscore, and a boy about eleven, have been lately awakened, and it is hoped converted, in <i>Essex</i>. May <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    feed them all with bread that comes down from heaven! We have blessed seasons here, and our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gives us to see his stately steps.
    <a id="p291"></a><span class="smcap">God</span> prepare me for a suffering hour! <abbr

      class="smcap">God</span>.”
    How easy may <i>Isaacs</i> be given up by them? But I forget I am weary, when writing to your Ladyship. Pardon my taking up so much of your precious time. I wish your Ladyship, your honoured Sisters, and children, all the privileges of the new-born, heaven-born sons of <span

    <i>Very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Received your kind letter on <i>Monday</i> last, and to shew you how willing I am to carry on a correspondence, I take the very first opportunity of answering it. Yours found me just returned out of <i>Yorkshire</i>, <i>Lancashire</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    Since you heard of me last, I have been at <i>Sheffield</i> and <i>Nottingham</i>, and found the fields every where white ready unto harvest. I believe my particular province is, to go about and preach the gospel to all. My being obliged to keep up a large correspondence in <i>America</i>, and the necessity I am under of going thither myself, entirely prevents my taking care of any societies. Whether it will ever be my lot to come over to <i>Ireland</i>, I cannot say. I have some thought of being there next Spring; but I would not intrude on any one’s labours. The world is large, and blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    there is a range and work sufficient for all. As for my manner of preaching, I believe, was you to hear me, you would find it calculated to serve all, but intended at least to offend none. I profess to be of a catholic spirit; I am a debtor to all; I have no party to be at the head of, and through <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    grace, I will have none; but as much as in me lies strengthen the hands of all, of every denomination, that
    <a id="p292"></a>preach <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> in sincerity. In this spirit I hope my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>
    will find me, should he ever see me in <i>Ireland</i>; but whether I shall go there or to <i>America</i> in the Spring, is not yet determined. Future things belong to Him whose I am, and whom I desire to serve to my dying day, in the gospel of his dear Son. I earnestly beg an interest in your prayers, and in the prayers of all that love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    in sincerity. Pray how do the poor people at <i>Cork</i>? Lady <i>H――</i> writes this concerning them. “I hope the poor persecuted people in <i>Cork</i> will be helped, and I should be glad if you could write in my name to any of them, and inform them that I would have written myself, but I know not how to direct. You may give them my kind assurance of serving them upon any occasion, and a hint that I believe they will meet with no more of the like rough usage.” Thus far my good Lady. I have informed her Ladyship, that I should write to you, who I am persuaded will gladly and in a prudent manner communicate this to all concerned. And now, my dear Sir, have I not returned you a long letter? I love you, though I know you not, and the more so because I hear you breathe a catholic spirit. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    increase it in your and all his children’s hearts! I must now add no more, but subscribe myself, very dear Sir,</p>

    <i>Very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">F</span>OR some few days I have been returned from my northern rout, in which the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> gave me to see new wonders every day. It was no small concern to me to turn my back on <i>Scotland</i>, when so near. However it hath been greatly over-ruled for good. I have thereby been called to preach in many fresh places, and, glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I saw thousands flock to the hearing of the gospel, like doves to the windows. The generous offer made me by yourself and lady, I took exceeding kind, and gladly would I have embraced it, but――Well! what is, is best. “Father, not my will but
    <a id="p293"></a>thine be done.” Perhaps I may see you in the Spring; if not, ere long, dear Sir, we shall meet in heaven. My wife tells me, she answered Lady <i>I――</i>’s letter immediately. In this she joins, sending most grateful acknowledgments and cordial salutations. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    we are both well, and surrounded with mercies on every side.—Only ungrateful, ill, and hell-deserving I, want a grateful and an humble heart. I am altogether an unprofitable servant, but our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    I trust will purge me, that I may bring forth more fruit: for by this, and this only, I know our heavenly father is glorified. What I am most afraid of is, lest I should flag in the latter stages of my road. But he that hath loved and helped, will, dear Sir, love and help me to the end. I am persuaded your prayers and the prayers of christian friends will be very serviceable. O that you may be kept alive and warm in this cold declining day! Poor <i>Scotland</i>, I pity thee! I will pray for thy prosperity till I can pray no more! Be pleased to present our joint love and cordial respects to all friends in general, and we entreat you and yours to accept the same in a most particular manner from, very dear Sir,</p>
  <p class="blk_90 align_ctr">
    Yours most affectionately in our common <span

    The verses were made by <i>T―― G――</i> who is now under my roof. He has grievously backslidden, but I hope is now returning home to his heavenly Father. We had an uncommon scene when he first came to me. I find the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will be sanctified in all them that come near him, and will not suffer those who are concerned in his cause, and with his people, to continue in sin long undiscerned. O that I may be kept simple, and honest, and zealous unto the end! Mine eyes wait upon thee, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    from whence alone cometh my salvation! I find he never fails those that put their trust in him. Blessed be his name, I have got sufficient to pay off <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>’s
    debts.—Poor, yet attempting at least to make many rich, I would have my motto still. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>
    also writes word, that the glorious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    hath raised sufficient for his charity school, and that he is much blessed in his labours. The book that hath been given to me for your Ladyship, I purpose sending next week, with one or two of the <i>Sundays Thoughts</i> for your Ladyship’s honoured sisters. Indeed I honour them very much, and pray for them and all related to your Ladyship very earnestly. I was glad to hear by <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>R――</i>
    that your Ladyship and all were so well. May you prosper and be in health both in body and soul! <i>London</i> already begins to disagree with my outward man, but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    smiling upon my poor labours sweetens all. I have begun to preach by six in the morning. We have large congregations even then. I trust we shall have a warm winter. I have not been at the other end of the town this week, but I find all hold on: however a leader is wanting. This honour hath been put on your Ladyship by the great head of the church. An honour conferred on few, but an earnest of a distinguished honour to be put on your Ladyship before men and angels, when time shall be no more. That you may every day add to the splendor
    <a id="p295"></a>of your future crown, by always abounding in the work of the <span

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Thank you heartily for your kind Letter, and yet more heartily thank our glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> for succeeding your charity school, and smiling upon your public administrations. I have sent Lady <i>H――n</i> an account of it, and earnestly pray the blessed Redeemer to own and succeed you evermore. My winter quarters are made very agreeable; but so much business crouds in upon me, that I have not time to write long letters. I am looking out for some fresh sermons for you. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>,
    with whom I spent some agreeable hours lately at <i>Northampton</i>, would let you have some, but his are all in short hand. Here is a volume of one <abbr

    lately deceased that I guess will do for you. A friend to-day promises to send me <i>Gurnall’s spiritual Armour</i>, of which I suppose you will highly approve. I will endeavour to bring or send it to you. I cannot think of stirring hence till after Christmas, but before the Winter is over, I shall long for the Spring to come, that I may enter on a fresh campaign. The encouragement given me this last fall, gladdens my poor heart, and makes me to long more than ever to spend and be spent for that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    who hath shed his precious blood for us upon the cross. I know those last almost parting words of our ascending <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    “Feed my lambs, feed my sheep,” will be engraven upon the tables of your heart. Our obligations to do so, are very great, at least mine are. O that we may embrace all opportunities of shewing that we love our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    more than every created thing. O for simplicity and godly sincerity unto the end of our race! Yet a little while, and we shall reach the goal and lay hold on the crown. Yonder our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    stands holding it out. It has those words written upon it, <i

    What is infinitely more, he will give us himself.

    You will urge all to press after it. Blessed be <span

    that you have so many around you that have a taste thereof. My hearty love attends them all. May the <span

    <i>Dear Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Thank you heartily for the acceptable favour of your letter, which came to my hand last night. It was quite welcome, as it bespoke the language of a heart panting after <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and desirous to be conformed to its great exemplar the blessed and holy <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    Go on, dear Madam, in his strength, who hath loved you and given himself for you. Confess him before men, and he will confess you before his holy angels in heaven. I am glad that Lady <i>H――</i> visits you often. Whenever you meet, may the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> cause your hearts to burn within you. What you propose for the poor cast-out clergyman, will be accepted of and rewarded by our common <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>, as done to himself. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I purpose waiting upon you next <i>Saturday</i> by eleven o’clock, and then I can receive your kind benefaction. <i>Colonel G――</i> being with me when your letter came, offered to accompany me. Perhaps <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>
    will come too. I shall see him this day, and shall be sure to inform him and his wife of what you desire. Good Lady <i>H――n</i> would gladly make one in addressing the throne of grace. But she is happy in yonder dead place, and <i>Dorcas</i>-like is always employed for the poor. Glorious privilege! Blessed redemption! <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    can make us happy any where and every where. You have a neighbour that dearly loves him. I mean the reverend <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Z――</i>,
    the king’s <i>German</i> chaplain. I believe, Madam, he would be glad to wait upon you; he has now three ministers with him, burning with the love of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and going to preach
    <a id="p297"></a>the gospel in the <i>East-Indies</i>. Have you seen a little piece entitled <i>Sunday Thoughts</i>? I think you would like it much. But I forget myself. I wish you the best of blessings, all the blessings of the everlasting covenant, and beg leave to subscribe myself, dear Madam,</p>

  <p>
    <i>My dear <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> L――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Find by your last kind letter that the king’s business requires haste. I therefore immediately dispatched it to good Lady <i>H――</i>, who I am persuaded will think it her highest privilege to serve the dear people of <i>Cork</i>. Whether your account of their sufferings has reached her Ladyship I cannot tell, but you will know soon. However this we know, that they have reached the ears of the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    who sitteth in heaven, and laughs all his enemies to scorn. He will take care that the bush, though burning, shall not be consumed, nay he will take care that it shall flourish even when in the midst of fire. In all our afflictions he is afflicted, and though the under shepherds be smitten, and his poor sheep for a while scattered, yet even this scattering shall be over-ruled for the propagation of the glorious gospel. It will be melancholy to have any preachers transported; but really the thoughts do not affect me so much, because I know what a field of action there is for them abroad. It has been my settled opinion for a long time, that <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    labourers (at least some of them,) love home too much, and do not care enough for those thousands of precious souls, that are ready to perish for lack of knowledge in yonder wilderness. We propose having an academy or college at the Orphan-house in <i>Georgia</i>. Supposing the worst, hundreds may find a sweet retreat there. The house is large; it will hold an hundred. I trust my heart is larger, and will hold ten thousand. Be who or what they will, if they belong to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    the language of my heart shall be, “Come in, ye blessed of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.”
    But perhaps this may not be the issue. The threatning storm
    <a id="p298"></a>may blow over, and all may be at peace again. It is always darkest before break of day. May the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> lighten the darkness of our minds! then we need not fear what men or devils can say of, or do unto us. Adored be his free grace for enabling you, dear Sir, to confess him before men, and to make <i>Moses</i>’s choice your choice. Great shall be your reward of grace, though not of debt: he will confess you before his Father and his holy angels in heaven. When you write, be pleased to salute the dear confessors at <i>Cork</i>. I love them in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, and pray the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all lords to give them grace to quit themselves like men, and be strong. If any of my poor writings might be useful, I will send some to <i>Ireland</i> at any time. O free grace, that the adorable <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    should ever make use of such a wretch as I am! This is free grace indeed. Help me, dear Sir, to adore it; and if at any time I can be serviceable, make no apologies, but write frequently, and command as well as pray for, my dear friend,</p>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Thank you for your kind letter. It bespoke the language of an honest heart. If I am not mistaken, your name is <i>Nathaniel</i>. This is what I fain would be, an <i>Israelite</i> indeed, in whom is no allowed guile. Such will <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    guide in his way. I therefore have no doubt of your receiving a blessing, a blessing, in what you intend doing next <i>Christmas</i>. You have openly called <span

    and his disciples to the marriage: and such proceedings are always owned of <span

    and all that love the blessed <span

    doings. Let us continue praying, and we shall yet see far greater things than these. You do well to meet at <i>Rotheram</i>. My cordial

      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    shall open a door, I fully purpose to have another stroke at Satan’s strong-holds in <i>R――</i>. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    can and will make us more than conquerors over all. Blessed be his name for leading you, my dear friend, more and more into the knowledge of his divine, compleat, and everlasting righteousness. That is a rock against which the gates of hell shall never prevail. If we have a mind to go pleasantly to <i>Canaan</i>, we must lean, not on our frames, not on a stock received, but on our Beloved. Looking to him is the only way of being saved from every evil that annoys and disturbs us. It is his blood, sprinkled by the blessed Spirit upon the conscience, and that alone, which cleanseth from all sin. Whatever, therefore, you want, go to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>:
    that is his name. And why? Because he is to save his people from their sins. And what amazing grace is it, that we should be in the number of his people? Surely that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>-exalting,
    that self-abasing expression, “Why me, <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    why me?” should always be in the mouth of one redeemed of the Lamb. But I must stop, though with regret. Whilst I am writing the fire kindles. I beg all your prayers;—no one wants them more. My wife returns her love. I believe good Lady <i>H――</i> hath no place suitable for the person you mention. Why should she fly from her cross? Sometimes we do best when surrounded by enemies: they keep us upon our watch. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is able to preserve us, though in a burning bush. To his never-failing mercy do I commend you all, and am, dear Sir,</p>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR kind letter almost made me to blush. I little thought, when I left <i>N――</i>, that you should have written first; but I have been so engaged since I came to
    <a id="p300"></a>town, that I could not well write to you before now. However, you have generally been in my thoughts; and I have not failed to remember you before him, who is able to save to the uttermost all that come to the Father in and through him. I see you are still under the rod, and I trust are enabled to kiss the hand that holds it. These afflictions, at present are not joyous, but grievous; nevertheless, through these many tribulations, we shall at length enter into eternal glory. By doing, or suffering, or by both, our active and passive graces must be kept in continual exercise. Your sufferings are of a peculiar nature; peculiar grace shall be given under, and a peculiar conquest granted over them. Look, my dear Sir, not to the <i>Mysticks</i>, but to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    Indeed, his righteousness is the only rock on which you can build any solid comfort. In this, and in this only are you compleat. This is the only breast-plate; and faith in this, a true, living, operative faith in this, is the only shield whereby the believer will be enabled to repel all the fiery darts of the wicked one. Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who hitherto hath given you to triumph, hath raised you from a bed of sickness, and set you on a throne, I mean your pulpit again. May the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> enable you to speak from thence both to him and his people, as becometh the lively oracles of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I find Satan does all that he can to prevent your using your pen. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will rebuke him in due time, and cause it yet to become the pen of a ready writer. I am glad you have opened a correspondence with our elect Lady. Keep it open I entreat you, my dear friend, and be not <i
      lang="la">nimis nullus</i>.
    Alas! if differences of every kind were to hinder any one, surely I must be the man. But in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is my strength found; and as my day is, so he causes my strength to be. Thanks be to his holy name, we have seen his outgoings frequently of late in <i>London</i>. His glory hath filled the Tabernacle, and many have been brought under fresh concern for their souls. I shall be glad to hear that <abbr
      title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    hath begun to speak for the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    But what can be done, till we are delivered from worldly hopes and worldly fears? Perfect, unfeigned love to the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    can only expel these. That your dear soul may constantly overflow with it, and that
    <a id="p301"></a>you may increase with all the increase of <span

    Now, my dear Sir, now is the time to shew your gratitude; now is the time to begin steadily to pursue the one thing needful. What avail the many things of this poor transitory world, in a sick and dying hour? Alas! they are nothing, and less than nothing. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    alone is all in all. He is the pearl of great price, which a wise merchant will gladly sell all to purchase. It is worth all, or worth nothing. O when shall it once be, that the children of this world shall not be wiser in their generations than the children of light! I trust my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    will labour to fulfil this wish, and with full purpose of heart cleave unto his once dying, but now risen, ascended, and interceding <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    When shall I love him more; when shall unworthy I serve him better? My obligations to do so, are increasing every moment. This last fall has been a glorious seed-time indeed. I have been in six or seven <i>Northern</i> counties, and thousands and ten thousands flocked to hear the word. I am now in my Winter quarters. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    is pleased to bow the heavens, and come down amongst his people. His glory fills the Tabernacle, and the shout of a king is heard in our camp. I wish I could hear of the revival of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    work among you. Let us pray, and not faint. You know who has commanded us to let him have no rest till <i>Jerusalem</i> be made a praise through the earth. Methinks I wish the months may fly away,
    <a id="p302"></a>wherein I am detained from coming to my dear <i>America</i> again. I entreat you to pray me over, and then I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of peace. The glorious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    deals bountifully with me here. I am better in health, than I have been some years.—My wife hath much improved in hers, since her arrival in her native country. She joins in sending most affectionate respects. Pray remember us to all in the tenderest, and most endearing manner; and believe me to be, my very dear <abbr

    willing, I shall read it to Lady <i>H――</i> and <abbr

    At that time, I am to give them the holy sacrament. Last <i>Saturday</i> I prayed with them; and in conversation, an aged gentlewoman was struck: I shall see how the physic works next visit. Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    the Holy Spirit has not done striving with sinners. I have had glorious accounts of the success attending the word in my last <i>Northern</i> circuit. Three or four fresh instances of conviction and conversion I have heard of here, within these few days. Whatever seems worthy of your Ladyship’s notice shall be sent. I wish I knew how a parcel might be best conveyed to your Ladyship. If your Ladyship remembers, last Winter application was made in behalf of one <i>Hill</i>, a Corporal. O that I could do any thing to express my gratitude to your Ladyship and honoured sisters. In public and private you have my prayers, which I trust will enter into the ears of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of Sabaoth. I think your Ladyship hath great encouragement to go on, striving to win souls to the blessed <span

      class="smcap">God</span> and Father of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
    for wounding and healing. This is his way. He wounds, in order to heal, and in the midst of judgment remembers mercy. Surely he is good in holding your soul in life, and being so much a staff to you in your old age. He has been a promise-keeping <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    He has not forsaken you when grey-headed, and when your natural strength must necessarily begin to fail you. Though it is cruel to hope you will be kept out of heaven so long, yet who knows, but I may see you, dear Madam, on this side eternity. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I purpose to embark some time next year without fail. The infinitely condescending Redeemer vouchsafes to crown my labours with great success; but in the midst of all, <i>America</i>, dear <i>America</i>, is not forgotten by me. Your family is peculiarly dear. I look upon you as my mother, and on your children as my brethren and sisters. I have lately been in <i>Yorkshire</i>, where I saw a widow, whose husband lately died in triumph, and who has five sons and one daughter all walking in the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Let this strengthen your faith, dear Madam, and encourage you to hope that you shall still see the travail of the Redeemer’s soul in the salvation of all your children,
    <a id="p304"></a>and be satisfied. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    Spirit seems still to be striving with them; and I trust he will not let them go, till they are enabled to give him spirit, soul, and body to be sanctified throughout. My poor prayers shall not be wanting. We often think and talk of you. My wife, with me, sends you and yours a thousand thanks for all your kindnesses. We are both pretty well, and have the satisfaction of seeing the glory of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    manifested in the great congregation. O what a blessed master is <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    I am just now come to my thirty-fifth year of age. I blush and am confounded, when I think for what little purpose I have lived. It is time now to begin to do something for Him, who has done and suffered so much for me. I beg, dear Madam, you will pray for me while life lasts. I am the chief of sinners, less than the least of all saints; but for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake under manifold obligations to, and am, dear Madam,</p>

To-morrow will be thirty-five years since you brought unworthy me into the world. Alas! how little have I done for you, and how much less for Him who formed me, and has heaped innumerable mercies upon me ever since I was born.

    By his grace, I hope now to begin to work for Him, who stretched himself on the cross, and groaned and died for me. His care for his tender mother, excites me to wish I could do any thing for you. This is my

    stamped in more lively characters upon my soul. My dear Doctor, let you and I begin to strive, not by way of contention, but in a way of holy emulation, which shall love <span

    I can send you good news now I do write. For near three months I have preached in many places, and thousands and ten thousands flocked to hear the glorious gospel. I have since had repeated letters of the impressions abiding upon the heart of many. Not unto me, not unto me, O <span

    but unto thy free grace be all the glory! At <i>Howarth</i> I met with <i>William Davy</i>, who has since been imprisoned for preaching.

I know his love will constrain you to give yourself, even your whole self to him in return. This is all he requires, “Give me thy heart.” Amazing! Who can help echoing back, “My heart, <span

    will I give.” But we must give it him as it is. We must come as poor, to be made rich, naked, to be cloathed, and miserable, to be made happy. O glorious exchange! precious redemption! May the <span

    shed a sense of it abroad abundantly in your heart by the Holy Ghost! It is he that must apply, and bring home what <span

    has done and suffered for our souls; and when this is done, the kingdom of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is erected in our hearts, and it is our privilege to go on from strength to strength, till grace is swallowed up in endless glory. This I hope, dear Madam, you will find true by happy experience. Your business is to look up continually to the <span

They are noted in his book, who has promised, “That a cup of cold water given in the name of
    <a id="p308"></a>a disciple, shall in no wise lose its reward.” What a beneficent master does the christian serve! Who would but be his disciple, whose service is perfect freedom here, and who hath reserved in heaven a crown of glory for those that love him hereafter? I thank him ten thousand times for calling unworthy me to embark in his blessed cause! It is indeed a cause worth embarking in. It gives me great Pleasure to think, that some poor souls at <i>A――</i> are under awakenings, and seem inclined to list under the Redeemer’s banner. Your Ladyship and honoured sister, I trust, will now have repeated opportunities of seeing not only how <span

      class="smcap">God</span>
    strips the Pharisee of his pitiful fig-leaves, hunts him out of the trees of the garden (I mean his own tinsel performances), brings him naked to the bar, makes him see himself on a level with the worst of sinners, and then sweetly reveals unto him a saviour. Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I have had some blessed instances of this very lately; especially a boatswain of a ship, who a few weeks ago knew no more of the corruption of his nature, and the righteousness of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    comparatively speaking, than the whistle he used to make use of on board ship; but now hath undergone a wonderful change. What cannot grace do? Honoured Madam, I could say much of it, was I not afraid of being tedious. I hope your Ladyship will not be offended at my presenting you with Bishop <i>Hall’s</i> works. I thought your Ladyship and honoured sister might now and then like to read one of the contemplations, which, in my opinion, are very delightful.

I have good news from <i>Virginia</i>. I hear every day of fresh persons lately brought under conviction. A learned gospel minister, who was lately turned out for the sake of <span

    I believe will be up here soon. Grace! grace! The more we are cast out, the more will <span

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE inclosed letters came to hand on <i>Monday</i> last, as a new-year’s-gift. As they bring such good news, I must communicate them to your Ladyship. The first writer is a <i>Virginia</i> planter, at whose house I lay, and who with some other gentlemen asked me to play a game at cards: I refused, and retired to pray for him. His present wife is my spiritual child. The letters will shew how <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was pleased to answer our prayers. This, and other things I meet with, more and more convinces me, that a liberty to range and publish the gospel wherever providence shall call me, is what I am to maintain and preserve. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>
    abides still, and as far as I can judge, disinterested. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for stripping seasons! I would not lose the privilege of leaning only upon the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    for thousands of worlds. He alone can make me happy, and he alone without foreign assistance can bless; and blessed be his name, he daily makes me so. He has been pleased to remove in some degree the pain of my breast, and gives me to determine more and more, that every breath I draw by divine assistance shall be his. I thank him ten thousand times that your Ladyship is so well pleased with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>.
    He expresses the strong sense he has of the obligations he lies under to the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
    and under him, to your Ladyship. O that neither of us may prove ungrateful in any respect! Next week I hope to let your Ladyship know how affairs go at <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>K――</i>’s.
    I expect to see her then. Lately his Majesty seeing Lady <i>Chesterfield</i> at court with a grave gown, pleasantly asked her, “whether <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Whitefield</i>
    advised her to that colour.” O that all were cloathed in the bright and spotless robe of the Redeemer’s righteousness! How beautiful would they then appear in the sight of the King of kings! This, honoured Madam, through free grace, is your dress. That your honoured sisters, and all your children, may be
    <a id="p313"></a>adorned in like manner, is the earnest prayer of, honoured Madam,</p>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR letter must not any longer lie by unanswered. It is a pleasure to me to steal a few minutes to keep up a correspondence with one I so dearly love, and with whom I am persuaded I shall live in the regions of peace and joy, through the endless ages of eternity. This the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> hath purchased for us, and of this, (for ever adored be his free grace) he hath given us an earnest! Supported with this, I am still enabled to pursue my delightful work of preaching to poor sinners the unsearchable riches of redeeming love. Thousands and thousands flock to hear, and we have had a blessed Christmas and new year’s season indeed. In the midst of all, I want more retirement. I want to read, meditate, and write. But I despair of getting much time for these things, till I get upon the mighty waters. In the mean while, I thank the Redeemer for letting my hands be full of work. These words lately have followed me, “Dwell in the land, be doing good, and verily thou shalt be fed.” These words embolden me to inform you of two that love <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and therefore I believe you love them, and I think they want assistance; <i>G―― F――</i> and <i>I―― H――</i>. The former I think has about eleven children, and scarce a crown a week to maintain them; and the latter writes me word, “He is about a guinea behind hand.” I am doing what I can for them, and if you would send them a small token, or now and then let me have a little to give to the many christian objects that apply to me, I know not how your generous heart could lay out a little to more advantage. You know the pleasure of doing for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    disciples. I labour to contract every expence, and to save all I can for the good of others. Ought
    <a id="p314"></a>I not to do so, to express my gratitude to him, who for my sake had not where to lay his head, and though he was rich, yet he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich. Much, yea very much of his divine unction do I pray may be given to my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    in his present plan. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    make your pen the pen of a ready writer, and after death may your writings be blest to thousands yet unborn! I believe they will. O my dear friend, whilst I am writing the fire kindles. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span> for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>! Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for all the mercies he hath conferred upon us! O that this new year may be filled with good works, flowing from a principle of love and a new nature! That the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    may bless and keep you, and fill you with all his divine fulness, is the continual earnest prayer of, my dear, dear old friend,</p>

  <p>
    <i>My very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">L</span>EST I should be hindered to-morrow, or in the beginning of the week, I now sit down to answer your kind letter. O that I may be helped to write something that may do you service, and be a means of quickening you in that delightful cause in which you are embarked. I see, my dear Sir, you are like to have hot work, before you quit the field:—For I find you have begun to batter Satan’s strongest hold, I mean the self-righteousness of man. Here, Sir, you must expect the strongest opposition. It is the <i>Diana</i> of every age. It is the golden image, which that apostate <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, Man, continually sets up; and the not falling down to worship it, but much more for us to speak, write, or preach against it, exposes one immediately to the fury of its blind votaries, and we are thrown directly into a den of devouring lions. But fear not, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>, the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    whom we serve, the captain under whose banner we are listed, is able to deliver us. He knows how to train us up gradually for war, and is engaged to bring us off more than conquerors from the field
    <a id="p315"></a>of battle. If any one need give way, it must be the poor creature that is writing to you, for I believe there is not a person living, more timorous by nature. But I trust in a degree, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    hath delivered me from worldly hopes and worldly fears, and by his grace strengthening me, he makes me often bold as a lion. But O, my dear Sir, this pretty character of mine I did not at first care to part with; ’twas death to be despised, and worse than death to think of being laughed at by all. But when I began to consider Him who endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, I then longed to drink of the same cup, and blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    contempt and I are pretty intimate, and have been so for above twice seven years. <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>’s
    love makes it a very agreeable companion, and I no longer wonder that <i>Moses</i> made such a blessed choice, and rather chose to suffer affliction with the people of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    make us thus minded! For there is no doing good without enduring the scourge of the tongue; and take this for a certain rule, “The more successful you are, the more hated you will be by Satan, and the more despised you will be by those that know not <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.”
    What has the honoured Lady suffered under whose roof you dwell! Above all, what did your blessed master suffer, who hath done such great things for you? O let us follow him, though it be through a sea of blood. I could enlarge, but time will not permit. I am ashamed of my unprofitableness, and must retire, after begging that you will not forget, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

    <i>London, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 12, 1750.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH I have missed two posts, yet the only cause of my not writing was a fear of being troublesome, and too particular and prolix in the accounts sent your Ladyship in my last letters. Your Ladyship’s kind letter this afternoon, together with the inclosed, which I received yesterday, give me fresh occasion to renew that pleasing employ of acquainting
    <a id="p316"></a>your Ladyship with some more particulars. Every day we have new hearers, and I find some or another are almost continually brought under convictions, or are edified at the tabernacle. I have offered <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    to assist occasionally at his chapel, and I don’t know but it may be accepted. Your Ladyship will hear soon. O that I may learn from all I see, to desire to be nothing! and to think it my highest privilege to be an assistant to all, but the head of none. I find a love of power sometimes intoxicates even <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    own dear children, and makes them to mistake passion for zeal, and an over-bearing spirit for an authority given them from above. For my own part, I find it much easier to obey than govern, and that it is much safer to be trodden under foot, than to have it in one’s power to serve others so. This makes me fly from that, which at our first setting out we are too apt to court. Thanks be to the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lord’s for taking any pains with ill and hell deserving me! I cannot well buy humility at too dear a rate. This is a grace after which your Ladyship pants, and with which our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will delight to fill you more and more. Your Ladyship’s letter convinces me, that those who know and do most, think they know and do least. If it were not so, grace itself would prove our bane, and goodness and zeal, through the pride and corruption of our hearts, be our destroyers. Honoured Madam, my hands and heart are continually lifted up for you, that you may abound evermore in every good word and work, and be cloathed with that humility which your Ladyship delights to wear every day; I mean that humble mind which was in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.
    I rejoice exceedingly in the comfort which your Ladyship has in <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>.
    I shall take care to cultivate our acquaintance, and earnestly pray that it may be blessed to our mutual improvement. I trust he will be a good soldier of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and doubt not ere long I shall hear of his receiving some wounds and scars of honour in the field of battle. After I left <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Z――</i>,
    by appointment I went to <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>K――</i>,
    to whom with the Countess, Lady <i>G――</i>, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>, and one <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>B――</i>,
    I gave the blessed sacrament, and afterwards a word of exhortation. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> was there, and your Ladyship <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    were remembered before him. On <i>Tuesday</i> next the blessed feast is to be repeated at
    <a id="p317"></a>the Countess’s house, and on <i>Wednesday</i>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I shall leave town for about five weeks. All I think are as hearty as ever, and I trust some will take deep root downwards, and bear fruit upwards. His Majesty seems to have been acquainted with some things about us, by what passed in his discourse with Lady <i>Chesterfield</i>. The particulars are these; her Ladyship had a suit of cloaths on, with a brown ground and silver flowers, which was brought from abroad. His Majesty coming round to her, first smiled and then laughed quite out. Her Ladyship could not imagine what was the matter. At length his Majesty said, “I know who chose that gown for you:—<abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Whitefield</i>;
    and I hear that you have attended on him this year and half.” Her Ladyship answered, “Yes I have, and like him very well;” but after she came to her chair, was grieved she had not said more; so that I find her Ladyship is not ashamed. O that she and all that have heard the gospel, may have grace given them to speak of their dear Redeemer, even before kings, when called to it, and not be daunted! I have also been with the Speaker about the poor people in <i>Ireland</i>. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>
    introduced me, and opened the matter well. His honour expressed a great regard for your Ladyship, and great resentment at the indignities the poor sufferers underwent; but said, “Lord <i>H――</i> or the secretary of state, were the properest persons to be applied to, and he did not doubt but that your Ladyship’s application would get their grievances redressed.” I wished for a memorial to acquaint him with particulars. He treated me with great candour, and assured me no hurt was designed us by the state. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>
    was quite hearty, and has the utmost respect for your Ladyship. To-morrow I am to preach at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>’s
    chapel, and I suppose on <i>Sunday</i> also. O that I may be a freed-man, and ready to help all that preach and love the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span> in sincerity! I bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span> for <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>,
    and am exceedingly obliged to good Lady <i>A――</i>. I am ashamed of the length of this, but as it is on business, your Ladyship will excuse, honoured Madam,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">L</span>AST <i>Monday</i> I waited upon the Speaker of the House of Commons, with one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>,
    a dissenting minister, who opened our poor suffering brethren’s case in a proper manner.—The Speaker expressed great resentment upon hearing of the indignities they had met with, and said, that if it did properly belong to him, he would make a thorough search into the affair. But he wondered application had not been made to Lord <i>H――</i>, who was the King’s representative in <i>Ireland</i>. He at the same time wanted to be informed of more particulars. For want of a memorial, I could only shew him the contents of your letter. Two things therefore seem necessary. Be pleased to send a well-attested narrative of the whole affair, and wait upon Lord <i>H――</i> yourself. A friend of mine intends writing to Lord Baron <i>B――</i>. Is he in <i>Dublin</i>? As soon as ever I hear from you, more may be done. In the mean while, the dear souls have my constant prayers, and shall have my utmost endeavours to serve them. I count their sufferings my own. Pray let me hear how they do. We have great peace here. The blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    manifests himself among us, and you know that his presence is all in all. Hearty <i>Amens</i> are given, when our friends are mentioned in prayer at tabernacle. To-morrow I am to preach at <abbr

    chapel. O that it may be for the Redeemer’s glory and his people’s good! I am a debtor to the <i>Greek</i> and to the <i>Barbarian</i>, to the wise and to the unwise, and think it my highest privilege to preach <span

    and him crucified to all. I know you wish me prosperity. Strange! that the love of <span

    <span class="dropcap">A</span> Few days ago I received your welcome letter dated <i>November 1</i>, at a time I was wondering that I did not hear oftener from you. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for dealing so favourably with my dear families, and for giving the prospect of such a plentiful crop! I take it as an earnest that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span> will be the <span
      class="smcap">Lord God</span>
    of <i>Bethesda</i>, and let the world see that designs founded on him shall prosper. I shall not wonder to hear by and by that you are P――t. O that you and I, my dear man, may be cloathed with humility, and the more we are exalted by others, the more may we be abased in our own eyes! Then will the high and lofty One delight to dwell in us, and prosperity itself, that dangerous thing, shall not destroy us. O that something may now be done for the poor negroes. A good beginning now is of vast consequence. Pray stir in it, and let us exert our utmost efforts in striving to bring some of them to the knowledge of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> and Saviour <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Z――</i>
    will readily concur in any proper measures for promoting so blessed a work. I sent him a copy of your letter, and the original to good Lady <i>H――</i>. This night I have agreed to take little <i>Joseph</i> and his sister. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H―― A――</i>
    hath been with me, and I find he is desirous, as are all their relations, that I should take them, for they will be but poorly provided for here. I think they have a kind of natural right to be maintained at <i>Bethesda</i>, and I have written to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    about it. I suppose in your next, you will acquaint me with particulars concerning their father, and how he hath left his affairs. I hear there is a very little infant, besides the other two. I would willingly have that likewise, if it could be kept till it is about three years old. I hope to grow rich in heaven, by taking care of orphans on
    <a id="p320"></a>earth. Any other riches, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    are out of my view. If the crop answers expectation, I would have <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>V――</i>
    and the other poor of <i>Savannah</i> reap the benefit. Pray let one <a
      id="p320a" href="#n_18">♦</a>barrel
    of rice be reserved for them. O what cannot, and what will not <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    do, if we put our trust in him! O for faith! O for humility! May I learn of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    more and more! He deals bountifully with us here. We have had a blessed Winter indeed!—I am pretty well in health, but my wife at present is ill. We salute you and yours, and all friends, and wishing you the best of blessings, I subscribe myself, my very dear Friend,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH I am wearied in walking to and from <i>South-Audley-street</i>, yet I must not omit sending to your Ladyship this night. I would have written on <i>Saturday</i>, but I waited to see the event of things. On <i>Friday</i> I preached at the chapel to a very crowded and affected auditory; <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    read prayers. On <i>Sunday</i> I read prayers, and he preached, and afterwards the sacrament was administred to about twelve hundred. More attended at the tabernacle than ever. Was it as big again, I believe on <i>Sunday</i> evenings it would be filled. This day hath been spent with the Countess, <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>K――</i>,
    Lady <i>G――</i>, Colonel <i>G――</i>, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>, and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>.
    I gave them the communion, and afterwards preached. The public minister from <i>Genoa</i> came to hear me, and I believe it was a profitable season. Lady <i>F――</i>, I hear, holds on, and writes word to the Countess, that she wishes all were as happy as she hath been in reading Bishop <i>Hall</i>’s contemplations. Since I came home, I have received the inclosed paragraph that was sent to a friend from <i>Portsmouth</i>. O that it may humble and quicken me! Surely ranging is my province. Methinks I hear a voice behind me saying, “This is the way, walk in it.” My heart echoes back, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    let thy presence go along with me, and then send me where thou pleasest.”
    <a id="p321"></a>Even so <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>, Amen and Amen! O that I had strength equal to my will. But indeed, honoured Madam, this body is a daily trial to me. Sometimes I can scarce drag the crazy load along. At present, I am too fatigued to enlarge. However, I would inform your Ladyship, that I do not leave town till <i>Tuesday</i> next. My wife hath been confined to her bed some days, but is now, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, upon the recovery. <span
      class="smcap">God</span> willing, I hope to write to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    and the poor baker soon. If your Ladyship wants any more books to dispose of, I hope your Ladyship will mention it in your next. Your Ladyship, Lady <i>Ann</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    were remembered heartily to-day. May the prayer enter into the ears of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of Sabaoth! I believe it will. I can only now commend your Ladyship and honoured relations to the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of all grace, and hasten to subscribe myself, honoured Madam,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Wrote to you not long ago, but that is no reason why I should not drop you a few lines now. I hope they will find you and your dear yoke-fellow resigned to the dispensations of providence, and chearfully saying, “It is well.” I write thus, because <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    informed me in his last, that old Madam <i>W――</i> was like to die. If she is yet alive, you will present to her my sincere love and service. I am endeavouring to prepare for my great change every day, by looking up to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and spending and being spent for the good of those souls for whom he shed his precious blood. Glory be to his great name, my labour is not in vain in the <span

    My work increases on my hands, and the prospect of being serviceable widens continually more and more. I beg the continuance of your prayers, and assure you that mine, such as they are, always attend you and yours and all my dear <i>Carolina</i> friends. O that the <i>Indian</i> land may become indeed wholly
    <a id="p322"></a>christian land! Is there any thing too hard for the <span

    long I hope to come and sow a little seed in your ground. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    make my way plain before me! The bearer of this is named <i>G――</i>; he once preached, but has (some time past) greatly backslidden. To save him from ruin I have taken him in, and have now sent him to <i>America</i>. If he keeps close to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and his book, he may yet do well. If not—he has good parts, and is of a good family. You will take no notice of what I write concerning him. I write to you as a friend. I mention it, that if he should turn out wrong, as I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    he may not, you may see I was not deceived. I hope you visit <i>Bethesda</i>, which I trust will be yet brought to something. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hasten the time, when we shall arrive at the <i>Bethesda</i> that is above, even that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens! I can now add no more, but my most cordial salutations to you, yours, and all, and subscribe myself, dear Sir,</p>

    <i>Very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Received your kind letter, and am glad to find the storm is a little abated at <i>Cork</i>. I always thought it was too hot to hold long. I see by <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    that suffering grace is always given for suffering times. If they have honoured him so far as to give him some lashes, for preaching the everlasting gospel, I shall rejoice. Such an instance of persecution, I am persuaded will stir up the resentment of persons in power on this side the water. I beg for the dear people’s sake, you would continue your accounts. They direct me in my prayers, and excite also the prayers of others. On <i>Monday</i>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, your letter shall be read, and in the strength of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    we will besiege the throne of grace once more, in our dear brethrens behalf. Surely we shall prevail. Neither will I stop, but use all endeavours to extricate our friends out of their troubles. Inclosed you have a letter to the Judge. You may send or deliver it as you think proper. I hope you will
    <a id="p323"></a>wait on Lord <i>H――</i>, and let me hear what he says. The Duke was spoke to, and last post I wrote to Lady <i>H――</i> for the memorial, which if sent, shall be put into the hands of some that are very near his Majesty. Some honourable women are much your friends; <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    makes them so, and when his people are distressed, if needful, a thousand <i>Esthers</i> shall be raised up. What are all these mountains in the sight of our great <i>Zerubabel</i>? Let him but speak the word, and they shall become a plain. I am glad my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>’s
    hopes begin to brighten. O for faith to look through every cloud! Ere long the sun of righteousness will shine upon us, and not one cloud be seen to intercept his blessed rays. I trust I can say, that we have lately felt many of his benign influences warming our souls, and the prospect of future usefulness increases daily. O for humility! O for gratitude and love! I have now preached three times in <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>’s
    chapel, and each time the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was with us of a truth. Next week I leave town for about five weeks, but if you write, your letters will be sent to me. In the spring, I am apt to believe the cloud will move towards <i>Ireland</i>; but future things belong to him, before whom things past, present, and to come, are one <i>eternal Now</i>. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>
    is much obliged to you for your kindness to his friend. He writes word, that you are a father to him. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will reward you for all your works of faith, and labours which proceed from love. Perhaps it may do no harm, to let some know that application has been made, and is making to several in power here, and that they all express great resentment at the <i>Cork</i> proceedings. I find their afflictions are my own, and I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    when they have gotten rest, they may not grow lukewarm, but like the churches of old, walk in the comforts of the Holy Ghost and be edified. O for that rest which remains for the people of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    It is just at hand. We have a blessed foretaste of it here: We shall have a full fruition in the Redeemer’s kingdom hereafter. I wait for thy salvation, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>!
    I can now only add my most cordial salutations, and beg the continuance of your prayers for, very dear Sir,</p>

    <i>Dear Tommy</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH I left <i>London</i> in a very weak condition, and the weather was but bad in coming down, yet the Angel of the everlasting covenant preserved and strengthened me, and I came to <i>Gloucester</i> last <i>Friday</i> evening. On <i>Saturday</i> evening I preached, and likewise on <i>Sunday</i> evening, and twice the same day in the country,—at the new house, and at <i>Hampton</i>. Hundreds attended that could not come in; and at <i>Hampton</i> all was still and quiet. I like that place very well. Yesterday morning I preached at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Fowler</i>’s, and our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gave us a blessed season from those words, “I am the bread of life.” On <i>Wednesday</i> I am to preach at the <i>New-house</i>, and on <i>Thursday</i> at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Fowler</i>’s
    again. From thence I think to go once more to <i>Hampton</i>, but am not yet determined. More come here than can enter, and some young fellows behave rudely; but that is no wonder; the carnal mind is enmity with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    <i>C――</i> was rejoiced much with the guinea. How thankful are some only with the crumbs that fall from others tables! Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    our branch of work is a poor branch; but if we are honest and disinterested, dead to parties, and aiming only at the Redeemer’s glory, and the good of souls, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will appear for us in a manner that shall even make his children astonished. I never was easier about his work than now. I see every thing in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    hands, and therefore every thing must end well. Go on then, my dear Sir, and let us be all heart. Remember me to your wife and all enquiring friends; and cease not praying for, my dear Sir,</p>

  <p>
    <i>My very dear C――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR kind letter reached me this day, just as I came out of the country from preaching the everlasting gospel, and where the blessed Redeemer was pleased to visit and
    <a id="p325"></a>greatly refresh his people. Last <i>Monday</i> we had a like feast; and in this place the word has been attended with an alarming and quickening power. Contrary to my intentions, I have been prevailed on to stay all this week; so that I do not expect to be at <i>Bristol</i> till <i>Monday</i> or <i>Tuesday</i> next. A letter, if you are pleased to favour me with another, may find me there next week. I am sorry to hear you are ill of an ague; but this, and every thing we meet with here, is only to shake and free us of our corruptions, and to fit us more and more for a blessed hereafter. As long as we are below, if we have not one thing to exercise us, we shall have another. Our trials will not be removed, but only changed. Sometimes troubles come from without, sometimes from within, and sometimes from both together.—Sometimes professed enemies, and sometimes nearest and dearest friends, are suffered to attack us. But <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is the believer’s <i>hollow square</i>; and if we keep close in that, we are impregnable. Here only I find my refuge. Garrisoned in this, I can bid defiance to men and devils. Let who will thwart, desert, or over-reach, whilst I am in this strong-hold, all their efforts, joined with the prince of darkness, to disturb or molest me, are only like the throwing chaff against a brass wall. O my dear Sir, what did I experience on the road this day! How did I rejoice at the prospect of a judgment to come, and in the settled conviction, that, to the best of my knowledge, I have no designs, no views, but to spend and be spent for the good of precious and immortal souls. O that I may be content to be poor, to make others rich! O that I may never be suffered to seek my own things, but the things of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>!
    His hand, without adding our carnal policy to it, will support his own cause, and make it more than conqueror over all. When fleshly wisdom, carnal reason, or human cunning is made use of, what is it, but, like <i>Uzza</i>, to give a wrong touch to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s ark, and in the end provoke <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to smite us? I love you, dear Sir, because I hope and believe you have a tenderness for all that belong to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to increase this spirit in you. For what we lose of this, so much we lose of heaven, and so far are we destitute of the mind that was and is in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    A bigotted, sectarian, party spirit cometh not from above, but is sensual, earthly, devilish. Many of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    children are infected with
    <a id="p326"></a>it; but then they are sick of a bad distemper. May the Spirit of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    convince and cure them! But whither am I running? Excuse, dear Sir, the overflowings of a heart, at present, I hope, filled with the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    It is free, unmerited, distinguishing, infinite love, or it would never flow into my ungrateful soul. As our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    enables, I shall remember all you desire. The King and his family I always remember in the most explicit manner. I hope you will succeed for <i>Miles</i>, and for the poor sufferers in <i>Ireland</i>. Learn of <i>Esther</i>, and go in the name of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    of <i>Nazareth</i>. Your relations are in the same condition as mine. Are we not as brands plucked out of the burning? Free grace! free grace! I hope to spend an eternity with you in praising the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all lords for it. You will remember me to all, chiefly to the friend of all. You know my name, “The chief of sinners;” but for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake, very dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH great pleasure (on my coming to <i>Bristol</i> last night) I heard of your Ladyship’s recovery from your late indisposition. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all lords perfect the begun blessing, and give you to live many years to be an ornament to his church, and a blessing to his people. Since I wrote last, we have been favour’d both in <i>Gloucester</i> city, and in the country, with very pleasant and delightful seasons. I have preached about twenty times within these eight or nine days; and though frequently exposed to rain and hail, thanks be to the ever-loving, ever-lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    am much better than when I left <i>London</i>. I hear that they go on well in <i>London</i>; and if we can be helped to keep a single eye, I am persuaded in the end we shall see greater things than ever. Every thing I meet with seems to carry this voice with it, “Go thou and preach the gospel; be a pilgrim, be a stranger here on earth; have no party, or certain dwelling-place; but be continually
    <a id="p327"></a>preparing for, and labouring to prepare others for, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” My heart at present echoes back, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    help me to do or suffer thy will; only let me be kept by thy mighty power, and when thou seest me in danger of nestling, in pity, tenderest pity, put a thorn in my nest to preserve me from it.” Hitherto he has in mercy answered my prayer; and though sometimes painful to the flesh, I thank him for it with my inmost Spirit. But surely no one’s heart requires so much pains to be taken with it, as doth mine. Surprizing, that the friend of sinners should yet regard me! I must still cry, “Grace! grace!” At present, honoured Madam, I am lost in wonder. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    be with your spirit, and with the spirit of your honoured sisters, whom I always remember. I doubt not but they were much concerned at your Ladyship’s illness. May they long live with you, to be fellow-helpers of each others faith, and to shine as lights in the world! I hope the work goes on at <i>Ashby</i>. How matters go on here, your Ladyship shall know hereafter. I purpose continuing at <i>Bristol</i> till <i>Monday</i> next. I believe my brother thinks it best to have your little orphan-boy as soon as possible. May the blessing of many ready to perish descend on your Ladyship! I must now add no more, but my most dutiful respects, and my sincere acknowledgements of being, honoured Madam,</p>

    that I can set up my <i>Ebenezer</i>, and say, “Hitherto hath my
    <a id="p328"></a><span class="smcap">God</span> helped me.” Words cannot well express how bountifully he has been pleased to deal with me. The prospect of doing good in my native country, is more and more promising every day. Last fall, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of the harvest was pleased to give us a most delightful seed-time in many places in the <i>North</i> of <i>England</i>;—in <i>Lancashire</i>, <i>Cheshire</i>, <i>Yorkshire</i>, <i>Nottingham</i>, <i>Newcastle</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr> the word of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    ran and was glorified, and I hear of fruit remaining in every place. At <i>London</i> this Winter, the glory of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    filled the Tabernacle, and since I have been in the country, we have had delightful seasons. I am now going <i>Westward</i>, and in about two months time purpose going to <i>Scotland</i> and <i>Ireland</i>, and then shall embark for my dear <i>America</i> once more. My health is much restored to me, and I only want an humble and thankful heart. O my dear friend, what cannot <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    do? Ought I not to spend and be spent for the good of souls? Ought I not to be always upon the full stretch for Him, who was stretched upon the accursed tree for me? Yes, the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    being my helper, I will now begin to be in earnest. And O that I may hear that a prayer-hearing <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has revived his work in dear <i>New-England</i>! You must let this serve as an historical letter, to be read to my dear friends. I would write to many, but indeed I have not time. I long as much to see them, as they can do to see me. I begin to count the days, and to say to the months, “Fly fast away, that I may once more spread the gospel net in dear <i>America</i>.” But my time and seasons are in thy hands, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>;
    do with me as seemeth good in thy sight, only let me love thee, and continue faithful unto death! You will remember me to my honoured friends and brethren in the ministry, and to all others as they come in your way. That grace, mercy, and peace may be multiplied upon you all, is the hearty prayer of, very dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">B</span>LESSED be the <span
      class="smcap">God</span> and Father of our <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
    who, in mercy to his church and people, is pleased yet to hold your soul in life, and make your Ladyship instrumental in plucking sinners as brands out of the burning. All these things I look upon only as the earnests of good things to come. Goodness and mercy will follow your Ladyship all the days of your life, and you shall dwell in the house of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    for ever. Lady <i>Ann</i>’s sudden shock proves that the old observation is true, “Seldom one affliction comes alone.” I rejoice to hear that her Ladyship is recovered, and pray the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all lords so to sanctify it to her Ladyship’s better part, that she may be ready at a moment’s warning to go forth and meet the heavenly bridegroom. O to be always ready! to have nothing to do, but to die! Surely the Redeemer hath purchased this blessing for us. Doth not your Ladyship find it difficult to be resigned to live, and to continue so long absent from the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?
    But there is one consideration which may make life desirable to the greatest saint on earth; he may here do and suffer for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and call sinners to him; but in heaven all this will be over. Come life then, come death, <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    may thy will be done in, by, and upon thy people! I know your Ladyship’s heart echoes back, Amen. But what shall I say to the opposition arising at <i>Ashby</i>? I trust it is a sign that good has already been done, and that more is still doing. The Searcher of hearts knows how highly I value your Ladyship’s letters; yet I think it honour enough to have leave to write to your Ladyship, without expecting punctual answers. O that I may gladden your Ladyship’s heart with glad tidings from the <i>West</i>! I believe I shall. I have been much helped in preaching here, and have heard of two that were thoroughly awakened when I was here last. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>,
    I think, does not lose ground. The persons that seem calculated to do him service, must be such as have a knowledge of themselves, of the world, and of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    whose practice proves their eye to be single, and their minds disinterested,
    <a id="p330"></a>and who have gone several stages before him to heaven. These would command respect from him; these he would hear, and to their judgment he would pay a great deference. The Captain, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    begins to be weary of his fine house; and I hope will be so uneasy in every worldly state, as to find no rest for the soles of his feet. May the glorious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    reach out the hand of his mercy, take him into the ark, and shut the door fast upon him! But I forget that your Ladyship is yet confined to your room. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    make it a <i>Bethel</i>, a house of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and a gate of heaven to your soul! He will, he will. I hear that the Tabernacle people are blessed in <i>London</i>. I am quite easy about that, and every other public concern, and desire nothing but to approve myself upright and disinterested in the sight of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and man. I hope your Ladyship will never find any thing to the contrary in, honoured Madam,</p>

  <p>
    <i>My dear <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> B――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Received your kind letter a few days ago at <i>Bristol</i>, and embrace this first opportunity of answering it. In <i>London</i> I was so continually busied with a multiplicity of avocations, that I could not possibly write to you from thence. However, it has pleased him, whose mercy endureth for ever, to give me and his dear people a very pleasant and warm Winter; and I trust much real good hath been done to precious and immortal souls. Just before I left town, I preached four or five times in <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>’s
    chapel, and administred the sacrament twice or thrice. Congregations were very large, and the Redeemer caused much of his glory to pass before us. At <i>Bristol</i>, and in <i>Gloucestershire</i>, we have had delightful seasons. At the former I saw and dined with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C―― W――y</i>,
    who talked about my preaching in their new room. I said but little, having, as the Searcher of hearts knows, to the best of my knowledge, no view to head or gather a party, but only to preach <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    crucified to all. In this I am blessed, in this I find
    <a id="p331"></a>unspeakable freedom, and to this, the necessity I lie under of labouring on both sides the water, evidently calls me. I am now going <i>Westward</i>. Some time in <i>April</i> I purpose, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, to visit your parts again in my way to <i>Scotland</i>, and then we can talk over many things. I think it is high time that all reasonings <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> about what is past, should be buried in utter oblivion. But I fear――However, this is my comfort—“The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    reigneth.” Our business is to be guileless, and to go forwards, looking continually to that <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    in whose cause we are embarked. He will order all things well. I cannot do any thing at present for <i>W―― D――</i>. I tried my utmost for <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>C――</i>.
    If he turns out bad, woe be to him, after such providential interpositions. I have no intimate correspondence with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>, but hear by <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>,
    that he is blest in the parts round about him. I see that he and all young preachers need the Apostle’s caution, to “Take heed, lest being puffed up with pride, they fall into the condemnation of the devil.”—And this I know, that no one will stand long in this work, unless he is disinterested, and looks for nothing but poverty, disgrace, and death. Whosoever is willing thus to lose his life shall find it; and, on the contrary, whosoever by sinister ends or practices seeks to save his life, the same (mark the end) shall lose it. For the present adieu! The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    be with you and yours! Be pleased to remember me to all as they come in your way. Direct as usual; and cease not to pray for, dear Sir,</p>

    and his gospel before men. A blessed earnest this, of your being confessed by him before his Father and the holy angels in the kingdom of heaven. The inward peace and satisfaction you enjoy by so doing, I am persuaded

      class="smcap">God</span>,
    who has given you to choose that better part, that shall never be taken from you! What have you to do now, but daily to sit at the dear Redeemer’s feet and hear his word; I mean, search the scriptures, which testify of him: and for His great name’s sake, let your remaining life be one continued sacrifice of love to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and man. This is true faith, even a faith that works by love, and overcomes this wicked world. Well may it be stiled <i>precious faith</i>. It is precious in itself, and precious in its fruits. It lays hold on, and unites to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and carries out the soul day by day after a nearer conformity to him. It goes on from strength to strength, and conducts the soul at length to the perfect and uninterrupted vision of the ever-blessed <span

      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    evermore give me this faith.” He will, Madam, he will: for he giveth liberally, and upbraideth not. Be not afraid of asking too much. Lay your foundation deep in the knowledge of yourself, and you cannot build too high. O that the worthy Captain may bear you company to heaven! I trust he will. Perhaps some time in the Spring, I may have the pleasure of waiting upon you. I am now in the <i>West</i>, and have had blessed seasons in my way hither.

    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE day after I wrote to your Ladyship my last letter, I preached three times, once at <i>Kingswood</i>, and twice at <i>Bristol</i>. In the evening I stood at <i>Smith</i>’s hall window and preached. It was a blessed day. The next morning our ascended Saviour gave me much of his presence, and I came on my way rejoicing. At <i>Taunton</i> I met with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Pearsall</i>,
    a Dissenting minister, a preacher of righteousness before I was born. At <i>Wellington</i> I lay at the house of one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Darracott</i>,
    a flaming successful preacher of the gospel, and who, I think, may justly be stiled (what <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Hieron</i>
    was some years ago) the star in the <i>West</i>. He hath suffered much reproach; the common lot of all that are owned in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    vineyard: and in the space of three months, he hath lost three lovely children. Two of them died the <i>Saturday</i> evening before the sacrament was to be administred; but weeping did not hinder sowing. He preached the next day, and administered as usual. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    strengthened him; and for his three natural, hath given him above thirty spiritual children: and he is in a likely way of having many more. He has ventured his little all for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>;
    and last week a saint died who left him and his heirs two hundred pounds in land. Did ever any one trust in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    and was forsaken? At his place I began to take the field for this <i>Spring</i>. At a very short warning, a multitude of souls assembled, and the bread of life, that cometh down from heaven, was dispensed amongst them. The following evening I preached at <i>Exeter</i>, where there is a little flock, and last night and this morning I have preached here: I humbly hope to the comfort of many. This afternoon, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I am to take the field again. What success I meet with here, and in <i>Cornwall</i>, your Ladyship shall know by another opportunity. I am now waiting for a letter from <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>,
    which I hope will bring me the wish’d-for news of the confirmation of your Ladyship’s health. This is what I continually pray for from my inmost soul. I am sorry to inform your Ladyship (if it has not reached you before) that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>
    of <i>London</i> is
    <a id="p334"></a>dead. I think he was one of the most lively, and like to have been the most successful Dissenting preacher in that great city: but our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    orders all things well. The residue of the Spirit is in his hands. Blessed Redeemer, quicken my tardy pace, and make me also ready! Good Lady <i>Ann</i> I hope is now perfectly recovered. But why do I talk of a perfect recovery in this dying life? Then only shall we be perfectly recovered, when we awake in the morning of the resurrection after our Redeemer’s likeness; then, and not till then, will my poor soul be fully satisfied; then, and not till then, will your Ladyship fully know how much the temporal and eternal welfare of your Ladyship is desired and prayed for by, honoured Madam,</p>

Hither I came last night, and have preached twice since my coming. Thus I live a moving life.

    <i>My dear <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> F――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">E</span>VER since I received your last kind letter, I have been endeavouring to redeem some time to answer it, but till now have not had opportunity. Indeed even now a multiplicity of business obliges me to be much more brief than otherwise I should. However, I cannot help informing you, that I am glad that the gentlemen of <i>Philadelphia</i> are exerting their efforts to erect an academy. I have often thought such an institution was wanted exceedingly; and if well-conducted, am
    <a id="p336"></a>persuaded it will be of public service. Your plan I have read over, and do not wonder at its meeting with general approbation. It is certainly well calculated to promote polite literature; but I think there wants <i
      lang="la">aliquid Christi</i>
    in it, to make it so useful as I would desire it might be. It is true, you say, “The youth are to be taught some public religion, and the excellency of the christian religion in particular:” but methinks this is mentioned too late, and too soon passed over. As we are all creatures of a day; as our whole life is but one small point between two eternities, it is reasonable to suppose, that the grand end of every christian institution for forming tender minds, should be to convince them of their natural depravity, of the means of recovering out of it, and of the necessity of preparing for the enjoyment of the supreme Being in a future state. These are the grand points in which christianity centers. Arts and sciences may be built on this, and serve to embellish and set off this superstructure, but without this, I think there cannot be any good foundation. Whether the little <i>Dutch</i> book I have sent over, will be of any service in directing to such a foundation, or how to build upon it, I cannot tell. Upon mentioning your desire to the King’s <i>German</i> chaplain, a worthy man of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    he sent it to me, and thought, if translated, it might be of service. Glad should I be of contributing, though it was but the least mite, in promoting so laudable an undertaking; but the gentlemen concerned are every way so superior to me, both in respect to knowledge of books and men, that any thing I could offer, I fear, would be of very little service. I think the main thing will be, to get proper masters that are acquainted with the world, with themselves, and with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and who will consequently naturally care for the welfare of the youth that shall be committed to their care. I think also in such an institution, there should be a well-approved christian Orator, who should not be content with giving a public lecture in general upon oratory, but who should visit and take pains with every class, and teach them early how to speak, and read, and pronounce well. An hour or two in a day, I think, ought to be set apart for this. It would serve as an agreeable amusement, and would be of great service, whether the youth be intended for the pulpit, the bar, or any other profession whatsoever. I wish also, that
    <a id="p337"></a>the youth were to board in the academy, and by that means be always under the master’s eye. And if a fund could be raised, for the free education of the poorer sort, who should appear to have promising abilities, I think it would greatly answer the design proposed. It hath been often found, that some of our brightest men in church and state, have arisen from such an obscure condition. When I heard of the academy, I told <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>,
    that the new building, I thought, would admirably suit such a proposal; and I then determined in my next to mention some terms that might be offered to the consideration of the Trustees. But I find since, that you have done this already, and that matters are adjusted agreeable to the minds of the majority. I hope your agreement meets with the approbation of the inhabitants, and that it will be serviceable to the cause of vital piety and good education. If these ends are answered, a free-school erected, the debts paid, and a place preserved for public preaching, I do not see what reason there is for any one to complain. But all this depends on the integrity, disinterestedness, and piety of the gentlemen concerned.—An institution, founded on such a basis, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will bless and succeed; but without these, the most promising schemes will prove abortive, and the most flourishing structures, in the end, turn out mere <i>Babels</i>. I wish you and the gentlemen concerned much prosperity; and pray the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all lords to direct you to the best means to promote the best end; I mean, the glory of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and the welfare of your fellow-creatures. Be pleased to remember me to them and all friends as they come in your way, and believe me, dear Sir,</p>

    <i>Honoured Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Was much rejoiced to hear, by a letter lately received from <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Bradford</i>,
    that your Excellency was pretty well, and am very thankful that you was pleased to enquire so cordially after unworthy me. I take this first opportunity of returning my most grateful acknowledgements, and to assure
    <a id="p338"></a>your Excellency, you are not forgotten by me at the throne of grace. Ere now, I thought to have waited upon you in person, but it hath pleased Him, whose I am, and whom I desire to serve in the gospel of his dear Son, to detain me longer than I expected in my native country. The door for usefulness opens wider and wider. The seed sown among the rich, springs up and bears fruit in some; and the poor in various places receive the gospel more gladly than ever. Last fall was a glorious seed-time in the <i>North</i> of <i>England</i>. In <i>London</i> we had a warm winter; and in the country we have had reason to sing, that “the voice of the turtle is again heard in the land.” <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I purpose ranging this Summer, and then to embark for my beloved <i>America</i> once more. Whether I shall see your Excellency is uncertain. You are upon the decline of life; and for my own part, I wonder that I live so long. But I trust I shall meet your Excellency in heaven, where the wicked heart, the wicked world, and wicked devil will cease from troubling, and every soul enjoy an uninterrupted and eternal rest. This I am waiting for every day; and according to the present frame of my soul, desire no continuing city, till I arrive at and take possession of the <i>New-Jerusalem</i> above. My Master makes ranging exceedingly pleasant; and I hope in his strength to begin now to begin to spend and be spent for him, who shed his own dear heart’s blood for sinful, ill, and hell-deserving me. O that death may find me either praying or preaching! I hope your Excellency will increase my obligations, by continuing to pray for me. My prayer for you is, “That your Excellency may bring forth much fruit in old age; and that whensoever you go off, you may be gathered like a ripe shock of corn into the Redeemer’s heavenly garner!” That you may till then go on from strength to strength, and increase with all the increase of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    is the earnest desire of, honoured Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Was ashamed to send your Ladyship so short a letter from <i>Plymouth</i>, but it was unavoidable. I was obliged to take horse, and therefore could only promise your Ladyship to send you particulars afterwards. At <i>Plymouth</i> I preached twelve times in six days, and the longer I preached, the more hearers, and the power that attended the word increased also. Friends grew more hearty, and enemies more softened. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i> and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>
    came to <i>Plymouth</i> to meet me. I preached at <i>Tavistock</i> in my way hither, and yesterday was a glorious day of the Son of man. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gave us to see his stately steps and out-goings in the sanctuary. Four of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Wesley</i>’s
    Preachers were present, and also four Clergymen in their gowns and cassocks.—<abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Bennet</i> aged fourscore, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Thompson</i>, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Grigg</i>,
    and myself. It was a day of fat things. By the advice and desire of friends, I am going further Westward, and shall take care to let your Ladyship know, how the <span

    is pleased to deal with me and his dear people.</p>
  <p class="secthdbrk align_rt">
    <i>Redruth, March 10.</i></p>
  <p>
    Though the above was begun at <i><abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ginnys</i>,
    yet I have not been able to go on with it till now. Every day I have been travelling and preaching, and could I stay one month, it might be spent to great advantage. At a place called <i>Port-Isaac</i> the Redeemer’s stately steps were seen indeed, and his people were filled as with new wine. At <i>Camelford</i> I preached with great quietness in the street. At <i><abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrews</i>
    we had a very powerful season, and yesterday at <i>Redruth</i> several thousands attended, and the word was quick and powerful. Invitations are sent to me from <i>Falmouth</i>, and several other places. I want more tongues, more bodies, more souls for the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.
    Had I ten thousand, he should have them all. After preaching, about noon I am to go to <i><abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives</i>,
    and in about nine days I hope to be at <i>Exeter</i>. Your Ladyship shall be sure to hear how the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    prospers the gospel plough. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>
    is mighty hearty, and gone to his parish in a gospel

    will some time or another turn their captivity. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>
    desired his most dutiful respects might be presented to your Ladyship. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that you are better. I am not forgetful of your Ladyship by night or by day. I hope the souls of your honoured sisters do prosper, and that you will yet live to see <span

  <p>
    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Think it is now almost an age since I wrote to your Ladyship, but travelling and preaching have prevented me. Immediately after writing my last, I preached to many thousands, at a place called <i>Gwinnop</i>. The rain dropped gently upon our bodies, and the grace of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    seemed to fall like a gentle dew and sprinkling rain upon our souls. It was indeed a fine spring shower. In the evening I rode sixteen miles to <i><abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives</i>,
    and preached to many that gladly attended to hear the word; a great power seemed to accompany it. On the morrow, being <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    day, I preached twice to large auditories, and then rode back again rejoicing to <i>Gwinnop</i>. In my way, I had the pleasure of hearing that good was done, and had fresh calls to preach elsewhere. In the morning I went to church, and heard a virulent sermon from these words, “Beware of false prophets.” On <i>Saturday</i> the preacher was heard to say, “Now <i>Whitefield</i> was coming, he must put on his old armour.” It did but little execution, because not scripture proof, and consequently not taken out of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    armory. On <i>Monday</i> I preached again at <i>Redruth</i>, at ten in the morning, to near (as they were computed) ten thousand souls. Arrows of conviction seemed to fly fast. In the evening I preached to above five hundred, at twelve miles distant,
    <a id="p341"></a>and then rode about sixteen miles to one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>’s,
    a wealthy man, convinced about two years ago. In riding, my horse threw me violently on the ground, but by <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    providence, I got up without receiving much hurt. The next day we had a most delightful season at <i><abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mewens</i>,
    and the day following a like time, at a place called <i>Port-Isaac</i>. In the evening, I met my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Thompson</i> again at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Bennet</i>’s,
    a friendly minister aged fourscore, and on <i>Thursday</i> preached in both his churches. Blessed seasons both! On <i>Friday</i> we went to <i>Biddeford</i>, where there is perhaps one of the best little flocks in all <i>England</i>. The power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    so came down while I was expounding to them, that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Thompson</i>
    could scarce stand under it. I preached twice; a commanding, convincing influence went forth a second time, and one came to me the next morning under awakenings. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    has here brought home a lawyer; and one of the youngest but closest reasoners that ever I met with, is now under deep convictions. On <i>Monday</i> evening I came to <i>Exeter</i>, and with great regret shall stay till <i>Friday</i>. For I think every day lost, that is not spent in field preaching. An unthought of and unexpectedly wide door is opened in <i>Cornwall</i>, so that I have sometimes almost determined to go back again. I beg the continuance of your Ladyship’s prayers, and hope <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    will let me know of your Ladyship’s welfare. You will not be forgotten by, honoured Madam,</p>

    has ran and been glorified. I am just returned from near the land’s end, where thousands and thousands heard the gospel gladly. I have generally

I have already laid your account before some particular persons, and shall use all possible means to have our dear friends grievances redressed.

The acceptance which the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> is pleased to give to me, and the various calls sent, as well as the freedom I find in complying with them, confirm me more and more that this is my province. I am just returned from the West, where I have seen the fields every where white ready unto harvest. Though thousands flock to hear the word in town, yet I almost think every day lost in which I am not preaching about the country, now the summer is coming on. <span

    only knows whether I shall reach as far as <i>Ireland</i>. Pray continue your accounts. I cannot help thinking, but that this opposition

    for removing prejudices from <i>Taunton</i> people? It is his doing; and the same grace was shewn at <i>Portsmouth</i>, from whence I am just now come. I was there this time twelvemonth, and now had the pleasure of hearing that many were then awakened, who hold on their way. Thousands came to hear, and the word seemed to strike like a pointed arrow. You have been misinformed about <i>Moor-fields</i>. I have preached there twice lately to many thousands, but without molestation. A blessed power attended the word, and we have had most delightful seasons in <i>London</i>. Help me to cry Grace! grace!

    You may direct to her Ladyship at <i>Ashby-place</i>. I am glad to hear that your brethren begin to envy

I believe they will be acceptable, because they acquaint you with the continuance of the Redeemer’s loving kindness to the very chief of sinners. At <i>Oulney</i>, where I preached last <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    day, we had two sweet seasons. A great multitude attended, and I had the pleasure of seeing some, that were wrought upon when I was there last. On the <i>Monday</i>, about six miles from <i>Northampton</i>, I had a private interview with <abbr

I expounded at his house in the evening, and am hereafter to come to it as my own. On <i>Tuesday</i> I preached twice at <i>Kettering</i> to several thousands. The people gladly received the word, and the Inn-keeper where I put up, I hope is a real christian. On <i>Wednesday</i> I came hither, and found good Lady <i>H――</i>, though very weak, yet better than I expected. I hope you will beg <abbr

    Kindness is cruelty here. Had <i>Abraham</i> consulted either <i>Sarah</i> or his affections, he never would have taken the knife to slay his son. <span

    Her ladyship is very weak, but I hope will yet be spared to do much good on earth. O the happiness of giving up all for <span

  <p class="quobrk align_rt">
    <i>Ashby, May 14, 1750.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Reverend and very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have desired to write you a long letter for a considerable time, but was so hurried when at <i>London</i>, that I could not be so explicit as the affair I wanted to write about, necessarily required. It is concerning the Presbyterian College in the <i>New Jersies</i>; the importance and extensive usefulness of which, I suppose you have long since been apprized of. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>,
    a friend of Governor <i>B――</i>, is come over with a commission to negotiate this matter; he hath brought with him a copy of a letter, which <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i>
    sent to you some months past.
    <a id="p349"></a>This letter hath been shewn to Doctor <i>D――</i> and several of the <i>London</i> ministers, who all approve of the thing, and promise their assistance. Last week I preached at <i>Northampton</i>, and conversed with Doctor <i>D――</i> concerning it. The scheme that was then judged most practicable was this, “That <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i>’s
    letter should be printed, and a recommendation of the affair, subscribed by Doctor <i>D――</i> and others, be annexed; that a subscription and collections should be then set on foot in <i>England</i>, and afterwards that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>
    should go to <i>Scotland</i>.” I think it is an affair that requires dispatch. Governor <i>B――</i> is old, but a most hearty man for promoting <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    glory, and the good of mankind. He looks upon the college as his own daughter, and will do all he can to endow her with proper privileges. The present President <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>,
    and most of the Trustees, I am well acquainted with. They are friends to vital piety, and I trust this work of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will prosper in their hands. The spreading of the gospel in <i>Maryland</i> and <i>Virginia</i> in a great measure depends upon it, and therefore I wish them much success in the name of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    But more of this when we meet. As I am going further northward, I know not but I may go as far as <i>Glasgow</i>. Indeed there are so many doors opened in <i>England</i>, that I know not well where to go first. I have lately been in <i>Cornwall</i>, at <i>Portsmouth</i>, and <i>London</i>.—Since that I have preached at <i>Oulney</i>, <i>Northampton</i> and <i>Kettering</i>. For a few days I have been at good Lady <i>H――n</i>’s, who though weak in body, is always abounding in the work of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    She sends you her kind compliments, and ordered me to beg the favour of you to acquaint <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>R――</i>,
    that she will answer his kind letter as soon as ever her strength will permit. I preach daily at her Ladyship’s, and this week, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I shall preach in two or three churches. My bodily health is better than usual, and I long to be on the stretch for Him, who was stretched upon a cursed tree for ill and hell-deserving me. I beg a continued interest in your prayers. I salute you and yours, <abbr

She is strangely employed now.—Can you guess? The kind people of <i>Ashby</i> stirred up some of the baser sort to riot before her Ladyship’s door, while the gospel was preaching; and on <i>Wednesday</i> evening, some people in their return home, narrowly escaped being murdered. Her Ladyship has just received a message from the Justice, in order to bring the offenders before him. I hope it will be over-ruled for great good, and that the gospel for the future will have free course. This week I have preached in three churches, and tomorrow morning, <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Cannot travel far without sitting down to refresh myself by writing to your Ladyship. <i>Mansfield</i> I hope was taken. After leaving that place, I went to <i>Rotheram</i>, where <i>Satan</i> rallied his forces again. However, I preached twice, on the <i>Friday</i> evening, and <i>Saturday</i> morning. The cryer was employed to give notice of a bear-baiting. Your Ladyship may guess who was the <i>Bear</i>. About seven in the morning the drum was heard, and several watermen attended it with great staves. The constable was struck, and two of the mobbers were apprehended, but rescued afterwards. But all this does not come up to the kind usage of the people of <i>Ashby</i>. I preached on those words, “Fear not, little flock.”—They were both fed and feasted; and after a short stay I left <i>Rotheram</i>, when I knew it was become more pacific. In the evening I preached at <i>Sheffield</i>, where the people received the word gladly. A very great alteration was discernable in their looks since I was there last. On <i>Sunday</i> great multitudes attended, and in the evening many went away that could not come near enough to hear. On <i>Monday</i> we had a parting blessing; and in the evening the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    fed us plentifully, with the bread that cometh down from heaven, at <i>Barly-Hall</i>. Last night I preached to many, many thousands, and this morning also at five o’clock. Methinks I am now got into another climate. It must be a warm one, where there are so many of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    people. Our Pentecost is to be kept at <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Thought to have troubled your Ladyship with a letter long before this time, but travelling, and preaching twice every day, prevented. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    it is pleasant work, and I trust it hath prospered in my unworthy hands. Thousands and thousands for some time past have flocked to hear the word twice every day, and the power of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    has attended it in a glorious manner. Good Lady <i>H――n</i> I left some time ago weak in body, but strong in the grace which is in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.
    The good people of <i>Ashby</i> were so kind as to mob round her Ladyship’s door, whilst the gospel was preaching. Alas! how great and irreconcileable is the enmity of the serpent! This is my comfort, “The seed of the woman shall at length be more than conqueror over all.” I hope that your Ladyship every day experiences more and more of this conquest in your heart. This is the christian’s daily employ; this the believer’s daily triumph, to die to self and sin, and to rise more and more daily into the image of the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    As it is our duty, so it is our unspeakable privilege. All the crosses we meet with, all the afflictions with which we are visited, are all intended by the good physician, to beat down, and keep under, and weaken the old man,
    <a id="p356"></a>and to raise up, strengthen, and give fresh vigour to the new man, which is created after <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in righteousness and true holiness. Our business is to look continually to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and to lean on him hourly, nay every moment. May this be your Ladyship’s continual employ! May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    strengthen, stablish, and settle you more and more in his love. May he give you to see your honoured Relations partakers of a divine nature in this world, and grant you mansions of eternal bliss in the world to come! No less mercies shall, no greater can be desired for your Ladyship and family by, honoured Madam,</p>

    <i>Rosindale (Lancashire), June 14, 1750.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">E</span>VER since that I heard your journey into the country was deferred, I have been impatient to write you a line. Till now, I cannot say I have had a proper opportunity. Travelling, and preaching twice a day, as I generally do, is almost too much for my frail tabernacle. But he is faithful who hath promised, “That as our day is, so our strength shall be.” Though faint, I am yet pursuing, and, glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    hitherto I have had a most delightful and successful circuit. I suppose you have heard of my reception at <i>Northampton</i> and <i>Ashby</i>, and of that people’s unkind treatment of good Lady <i>H――</i>. At <i>Nottingham</i> I lodged with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>,
    and in that place and several others found great success. In <i>Yorkshire</i> the work hath advanced most. In about a week’s time, within the compass of twenty miles, I preached, I believe, to above six thousand souls. This last week I have been beating up for recruits in and about <i>Manchester</i>, and I trust some have listed. <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>G――</i>
    behaves like a good soldier; and if I am not mistaken, her husband will follow her good example. I am now going towards <i>Kendal</i>, then to <i>Whitehaven</i>, and it may be to <i>Scotland</i>. I know you will pray, that the hand of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    may be with me. That is all in all! I hope this will find
    <a id="p357"></a>my dear friend quite busy for his <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, even his <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    We have not a moment to be idle here; the Judge is before the door. I want to have my lamp trimmed, and my loins girt, and to be always habitually and actually ready to meet the blessed Bridegroom. Then do we begin to live like ourselves, and to act like those who are redeemed unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span> by the precious blood of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and made kings and priests unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and his Father; to him be glory and dominion now and for evermore. My dear Sir, my cold heart is warmed when I think of this. O why am I not a flame of fire? Why am I not all life, all love, all humility, all zeal? O my naughty heart! May <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    sprinkle it afresh with his precious blood, and help me this morning to begin to hunt for souls. Though aged, I wish you may be employed in the same work before you die. But future things belong to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I must now bid you adieu. My cordial love and respects await <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>C――</i>, <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>,
    and all enquiring friends. Continue to pray for, very dear Sir,</p>

    I advised him to send your Ladyship word of their coming to <i>Ashby</i>, that they might be directed the best road from <i>Derby</i>. We had sweet seasons at the places adjacent to <i>Manchester</i>. Only at <i><a

    a drunkard stood up to preach behind me, and a woman attempted twice to stab the person that was putting up a stand for me to preach on, in her husband’s field. However, the <span

    got himself the victory. Since that, we have had very large and powerful meetings,
    <a id="p358"></a>where formerly were the most violent outrages. Perhaps within these three weeks, sixty-thousand souls or upwards have heard the gospel. I am now in <abbr

    comforts and supports me, and, I believe, will hear your Ladyship’s prayers in behalf of one, who, next to being a poor despised minister of the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i>, thinks it his highest honour to subscribe himself,</p>

      class="smcap">God</span>.
    This leaves me at <i>Kendal</i>, where I arrived this morning, and where, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I shall preach the everlasting gospel this evening. An entrance is now made into <i>Westmoreland</i>; and pen cannot well describe what glorious scenes have opened in <i>Yorkshire</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    Perhaps since I saw you, seventy or eighty thousand have attended the word preached in divers places. At <i>Howarth</i>, on <i>Whitsunday</i>,
    <a id="p359"></a>the church was almost thrice filled with communicants, and at <i>Kirby-Steven</i> the people behaved exceedingly well. It was a precious season. In my way I have read <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Law</i>’s
    second part of <i>The Spirit of Prayer</i>. His scheme about the Fall, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    I think is quite chimerical; but he says many things that are truly noble, and which I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to write upon the tables of my heart. Several things at the end of his treatise on regeneration, in my opinion, are entirely unjustifiable: but the sun hath its spots, and so have the best of men. I want to see my own faults more, and others less. It will be so, when I am more humble. If mercies would make a creature humble, I should be a mirror of humility. But I am far from the mind that was in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    You must pray, whilst I go on fighting. Though faint, I would yet pursue. Next week I hope to reach <i>Edinburgh</i>. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, you shall have notice of my return. Glad shall I be to meet such a friend upon the road. May the friend of sinners bless and support you, and give you always an heart to pray for, reverend and very dear Sir,</p>

    must be your motto, and mine. There is nothing like keeping the wheels oil’d by action. The more we do, the more we may do; every act strengthens the habit: and the best preparation for preaching on <i>Sundays</i>, is to preach every day in the week.

    what blessed opportunities do you enjoy for meditation, study, and prayer! Now is your time to get rich in grace, to search into the depths of divine love, and the mystery of iniquity hid in your own heart. Such an example, and such advantages no one in <i>England</i> is favoured with but yourself. I do not envy you; but I pray the Redeemer, from my inmost soul, to sanctify your situation, and give you to increase with all the increase of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I am called forth to battle; remember a poor cowardly soldier, and beg the Captain of our salvation, that I may have the honour to die fighting. I would have all my fears in my breast. Methinks I would not be wounded running away, or skulking into an hiding-place. It is not for ministers of <span

The congregation was greatly increased, and the power of the <span

    was displayed in the midst of them. On <i>Saturday</i> evening, and on the Lord’s-day, I preached at <i>Ulverston</i>, a town about sixteen miles distant from this. There Satan made some small resistance; a clergyman, who looked more like a butcher than a minister, came with two others and charged a constable with me; but I never saw a poor creature sent off in such disgrace.

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>ESTERDAY, upon my arrival hither, I received your kind letter, and am now seated to send you an answer. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    cause it to be answer of peace! You need make no apology for your openness and freedom; reserves to me are odious. I would willingly be a father, brother, and friend to all concerned with me; and consequently I would gladly bear a part with them in their sorrows and their joys. Your suspicions about <abbr
      title="Misters">Messrs.</abbr>
    <i>S――</i>, <i>G――</i>, and <i>N――</i>, were groundless. The sole cause of your not hearing from me, was my not knowing where to direct to you. As I am utterly unconcerned in the discipline of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>’s
    societies, I can be no competent judge of their affairs. If you and the rest of the preachers were to meet together more frequently, and tell each other your grievances, opinions, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    it might be of service. This may be done in a very friendly way, and thereby many uneasinesses might be prevented. After all, those that will live in peace must agree to disagree in many things with their fellow-labourers, and not let little things part or disunite them. I know not well, what my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    means, about concealing the gospel privileges. There is no doubt but milk must be given to babes, and meat to strong men; but this all depends on the skilfulness of the preacher, and his being taught of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    rightly to divide the word of truth. In general, gospel privileges may be
    <a id="p363"></a>spoken of to encourage awakened sinners and quicken saints. If by gospel privileges you mean <i>love-feasts</i>, <i>bands</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    these I think are only prudential means, and therefore no doubt prudence should be exercised in the use of them. I am of your opinion, that too much familiarity in these things is hurtful. But it is hard to keep a medium, where a multitude is concerned. As ill effects are discovered, they should be corrected and avoided. The question and answer you refer to, I do not like. I know nothing of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    righteousness being imputed to all mankind. It is enough to say with the scriptures, “That it is imputed to all believers.” What does my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    think of that assertion of the Apostle, “He made him sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, in him.” And again, “Who of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is made to us, wisdom, righteousness, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>” <i
      lang="la">cum multis aliis</i>, vide Romans, <abbr
      title="fourth">ivth</abbr> and <abbr
      title="fifth">vith</abbr>.—Is
    it not as express as can be, that <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    righteousness is imputed to believers? Consequently, it is sufficient for us, as preachers, to declare, “That all believers are actually delivered from the guilt of both actual and original sin, from the power of their corruptions here, and that at the hour of death they shall be delivered from the very in-being of sin, and be admitted to dwell with the glorious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and the spirits of just men made perfect, hereafter.” Another seven years experience, will teach some to handle the word of life in a better manner. Our business is to shew believers their compleatness in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and to point them to Him for strength for every good word and work; and all to be done out of gratitude and love for what he hath done and suffered for them. But you know my sentiments; you have heard them all in my sermons. I have no reserves. What <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    says, I know not; I believe <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    redemption will be applied to all that shall believe. Who these are, we know not, and therefore we are to give a general offer and invitation; convinced of this, that every man’s damnation is of himself, and every man’s salvation all of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    You would do well to read more; but whether it would be best for you to pursue, or re-assume your old studies, unless you are determined to settle, I cannot tell. Reading a <i>Latin</i> author, a little every day, to be sure could do you no hurt. <i
      lang="la">Terentius Christianus</i>, <i
      lang="la">Castalio</i>’s Scripture Dialogues, and <i
      lang="la">Selectæ Prælectiones Veteri
    <a id="p364"></a>Testamenti</i>, would both delight and profit you. It has long since been my judgment, that it would be best for many of the present preachers to have a tutor, and retire for a while, and be content with preaching now and then, till they were a little more improved. Otherwise, I fear many who now make a temporary figure, for want of a proper foundation, will run themselves out of breath, will grow weary of the work, and leave it. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    direct! This is the plan I purpose to pursue abroad. Whether <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    will be pleased to succeed it, I know not. All I can say is, that I am willing to lend an helping hand wherever I see the interest of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    promoted. This is my motive, dear Sir, in answering your last. I hope it is satisfactory. If not, let me know. You may direct for me at <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>’s,
    <i>Edinburgh</i>. I hope to be there next week. We have had good seasons since I parted from you. At <i>Kendal</i> a most promising door is opened. Follow me with your prayers.—Look up to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and let not little things disappoint and move you. If this be your foible, beware, and pray that Satan may not get an advantage over you. He will be always striving to vex and unhinge you. “The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    reigneth.” Let this consideration support and comfort you, under the various changes you must necessarily meet with in the church. She is now militant, ere long she shall be triumphant. Till then, as the elect of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    let us put on bowels of compassion, meekness, long-suffering and humbleness of mind. But what am I doing? Adieu. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> be with you and yours, and give <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    faith and courage in her approaching hour! All with me salute you. I must hasten to subscribe myself, my dear <abbr

It is amazing to see how people are prepared, in places where I never was before. What shall I render unto the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?
    I will beg him to make me humble and thankful. Here, I am received with as much affection as ever. Still I will cry, Grace! grace! Ere this reaches you, I suppose you will be thinking of <i>London</i>. <abbr

Several of ―― have offered to join me; but you know I hate taking other persons as helpers, and as I desire no party, I give no encouragement. But future things belong to Him, on whose shoulders the government is put. You must still remember me before Him. His word is indeed running, and like to be glorified day by day. How matters go on here, you will know hereafter. In the mean while pray for, and write to, my very dear <i>Tommy</i>,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER preaching at <i>Cockermouth</i>, and near <i>Wigton</i>, with great acceptance, last night I came here, and was received in a most loving and tender manner. At noon, I dined with a family that honours your Ladyship very much, and this evening I have been preaching to a great multitude of very attentive and affected hearers. At my return to my lodgings, I had the wished-for pleasure of your Ladyship’s two letters. They both led me nearer to, and laid me lower before Him, at whose throne I am daily pleading for the welfare of your Ladyship, both in temporals and spirituals. Indeed, ever honoured Madam, I have confidence with you that your Ladyship shall have all the deliverance you long for. By divine grace, I will let the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    have no rest, till he fulfils all your desires. I quite forget myself, when I think
    <a id="p366"></a>of your Ladyship. Ever honoured Madam, the <span

I hope soon to send your Ladyship some pleasing particulars. I have heard from my family. May the blessing of many ready to perish descend on your Ladyship. I pity poor <i>A―― B――</i>. Your Ladyship I believe will soon get the better of him. Your Ladyship hath acted like yourself in forgiving the offenders. Such offences come, that <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    followers may give evidence of his blessed temper being wrought in their hearts. In my return, without fail your Ladyship may expect me at ungrateful <i>Ashby</i>. Out of those stones may the <span

    raise up children unto <i>Abraham</i>! However <span

For I would fain owe no man any thing but love.—I would have my worldly affairs so ordered, that let death come when it will, I may have nothing to do but to die. That is a blessed word to me; the thoughts of death gladden my heart, and cause me often almost to leap for joy. But perhaps our <span

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Received your kind letter last week, but till now had not time to answer you. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    it brought glad tidings. Thanks be to the ever-loving ever-lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    for causing his arrows to stick fast in any sinners hearts! May he that hath wounded, in his own due time and way heal and ease them!—He is the awakened sinners only refuge. To Him the weary and heavy laden are invited. Let them but come to him, and he will, indeed he will give them rest. O that those who have begun to put their hands to the plough, may be kept from looking back! Awakening times are like spring times. Many blossoms, but not always so much fruit. However, glory, glory be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that the Winter of deadness is in some degree over, and that a Spring time of grace is seen at <i>Kendal</i>. Pray remember me in the kindest manner to all under awakenings, and exhort them all with full purpose of heart to cleave unto the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    Whether I can see you again in my return, is uncertain. If it be any way practicable, I shall comply with your earnest solicitation. Next week, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I leave <i>Scotland</i>, and if I can come, you shall hear from me. In the mean time, as the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    enables, I shall not cease to pray for all that are setting their faces Zionward. You know the many turnings that lie in the way thither, and therefore can direct young travellers. It is pretty work for you in the decline of life. Methinks you may be surprized like <i>Sarah</i>, who said, “who would have thought that <i>Sarah</i> should have given suck!” But is there any thing too hard for the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?
    O for faith, patience and humility! These are graces my soul thirsts after. How humble, how thankful ought I to be! After leaving <i>Kendal</i>, the word of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    ran and was glorified in several places, and in <i>Scotland</i> I think congregations are rather greater than ever. You must exhort all to pray for me, that I may be kept from flagging in the latter stages of my road. My love to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>.
    I shall take care to answer his letter when it comes to hand. I have ordered some volumes of my sermons to be sent to him. May <span

    sanctify the reading of them to the

Your Ladyship’s condescension in writing to unworthy me, lays me low before Him, who continues to follow me with his goodness and mercy every hour of my life. Ungrateful <i>Ashby</i>! O that thou knewest the day of thy visitation! Surely your Ladyship may shake off the dust of your feet against them. This was the command, that the meek and lowly <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    gave to his apostles, when the gospel was not received. And he himself departed, when the <i>Gadarenes</i> desired him to go out of their coasts. This justifies your Ladyship in removing <abbr

    What avails throwing pearls before swine, who only turn again and rend you? However, I bless <span

    that your Ladyship’s house is made a <i>Bethel</i>. Glad would I be of the honour of joining your Ladyship’s little select company, but our Redeemer appoints me other work.—Indeed it is very pleasant work. No one can well describe the order, attention, and earnestness of the <i>Scotch</i> congregations. They are unwearied in hearing the gospel. I left thousands sorrowful at <i>Glasgow</i>, and here I was again most gladly received last night. By preaching always twice, and once thrice, and once four times in a day, I am quite weakened; but I hope to recruit again, and get fresh strength to work for Him, who shed his precious blood for ill and hell-deserving me. On <i>Thursday</i> next, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I shall leave <i>Scotland</i>. Your Ladyship shall know whither I go. In the mean while, I send your Ladyship some <i>Georgia</i> letters, which I hope will afford you satisfaction. I have been upon the enquiry for some proper persons, for dear Captain <i>G――</i> and his Lady to converse with at <i>Dumfries</i>, and last night I hear I have succeeded. Particulars they shall know hereafter. I can now only send them my most grateful and cordial respects, being obliged to stop to get strength even whilst I
    <a id="p371"></a>write this. O this mortal body! How does it weigh down my precious and immortal soul! Ere long it will be set at liberty, and body and soul shall be for ever with the <span

    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>T length I have taken a very sorrowful leave of <i>Scotland</i>. The longer I continued there, the more the congregations, and the power that attended the word, increased. I have reason to think that many are under convictions, and am assured of hundreds having received great benefit and consolation. The parting was rather more affectionate than ever, and I shall have reason to bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to all eternity for this last visit to <i>Scotland</i>. Not a dog moved his tongue all the while I was there, and many enemies where glad to be at peace with me. Who is like our <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, continually doing wonders! Preaching so frequently, and paying so many religious visits, weakened me very much; but I am already much better for my riding thus far, and I trust the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will cause me to renew my strength. My obligations to spend and be spent for the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    are greatly increased. O that I may spring afresh, and soar aloft till I fly into the embraces of a sin-forgiving <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    He hath prepared my way at <i>Berwick</i>. One of the ministers hath sent me an offer of his pulpit, and I hear of about ten more round this town that would do the same. I came hither this evening, and purpose, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, to set out for <i>Newcastle</i> on <i>Monday</i> morning. What success I meet with, your Ladyship shall hear in my next. Was it not so late in the year, I think I would go to <i>Ireland</i>. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    direct my goings in his way! <i>Kendal</i>, I believe, must have another visit.
    <a id="p372"></a>The enclosed is from one of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>’s
    preachers. The contents I believe will please your Ladyship. Honoured Madam, what shall I say? The Redeemer’s goodness quite amazes me. “Less than the least of all,” shall be my motto still. With regret, I send your Ladyship <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>’s
    too, too much embellished and extravagant character of ill and hell-deserving me. It came from <i>Plymouth</i> last post. Your Ladyship desired to see it, or otherwise I could not bear to send it. To me, O blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    nothing belongs, but shame and confusion of face. O that praise as well as contempt may humble this proud heart of mine! Then I shall never be hurt by having the honour to subscribe myself, honoured Madam,</p>

  <p>
    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>O day my wife sent me the melancholy news of the death of your Ladyship’s eldest daughter, but withal wrote me that she died very comfortably. Indeed when I left her, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    spirit seemed to be working so strongly upon her heart, that I thought she would soon go to heaven, or shine as a glorious saint on earth. It hath pleased a sovereign <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to cut short his work in righteousness, and call her home. A trial this indeed, for your Ladyship! but a trial, in which I hope your Ladyship will have grace given to acquiesce. O that with <i>Aaron</i> you may be enabled to hold your peace, and with the bereaved <i>Shunamite</i> to say, “It is well.” And if the Redeemer should call your Ladyship to part with another daughter (hard trial for flesh and blood) may you be strengthened chearfully to give her up, and hear the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords saying unto you, “Now know I that thou lovest me, since thou hast not with-held two dear daughters from me.” Now is the time, honoured Madam, to prove the strength of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    to be yours. Now is the time to be strong in faith, and give glory to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    The Redeemer will be better to you than seven daughters. What a comfort is it, honoured Madam, for you to think that Miss <i>C――</i> gave such comfortable evidences of her dying in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    She is blessed indeed, and the language of her departed soul is, “weep not for me.” Comfort yourself, honoured Madam, with this thought, and say like <i>David</i>, “I shall go to her, but she will not return to me.” May this trial be sanctified to your Ladyship’s whole household, and may your surviving children learn to die betimes! I could enlarge, but am afraid of being troublesome. On <i>Tuesday</i>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I hope to be in <i>London</i> for one day, and shall be impatient to know how the all-wise <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is pleased to dispose of your Ladyship’s other daughter. In the mean while, my poor prayers shall be put up night and day, that your Ladyship may have grace given you to glorify <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    <a id="p375"></a>in this time of need. I commend your Ladyship to his never-failing mercy, as being, honoured Madam,</p>

    of all Lords, whose mercy endureth for ever. Surely, his goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life, and blessed be his holy name, I shall ere long dwell in his house for ever. At my return to town, I was received, though utterly unworthy, with great joy, and our <span

    has manifested forth his glory in the great congregation. I have preached in <abbr

    breakfasted and prayed with me this morning, and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――y</i>

I have prevailed on him to sit for his picture, and it will be published in a short time. Two dozen of my pictures, as my friends so earnestly desired them, are sent directed to you.

      class="smcap">God</span>
    was pleased to awaken when I was there, went off lately (as my friend expresses it) “with flying colours.” Grace! Grace! <span

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH it is a cross to me to be detained so long from coming to <i>Ashby</i>, yet I trust hitherto my steps have been guided by an over-ruling providence for good. Yesterday afternoon I returned from <i>Chatham</i>, where I think there is as promising a work begun as almost in any part of <i>England</i>. Last night the Redeemer’s glory was seen in the tabernacle, and your Ladyship’s letter revived my heart, and gave me some fresh hopes for ungrateful <i>Ashby</i>. My heart’s desire and prayer to the <span

    Your Ladyship will be remembered most heartily before him this afternoon, it being our letter-day.

  <p class="quobrk align_rt">
    <i>Gloucester, <abbr
      title="September">Sept.</abbr> 22, 1750.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">A</span>S I know your Ladyship had a great esteem for the late honourable Miss <i>H――</i>, I cannot but think a short account of her behaviour, under her last sickness, must not only alleviate the concern your Ladyship must necessarily have for so intimate a friend, but also excite you to pray, that your latter end may be like hers. I think it is now near three weeks since good Lady <i>G――</i> desired me to visit her sick daughter. She had been prayed for very earnestly the preceding day after the sacrament, and likewise previous to my visit in Lady <i>H――</i>’s room. When I came to her bedside, she seemed glad to see me, but desired I would speak and pray as softly as I could. I conversed with her a little, and she dropped some strong things about the vanity of the world, and the littleness of every thing out of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I prayed as low as I could, but in prayer (your Ladyship has been too well acquainted with such things to call it <i>enthusiasm</i>) I felt a very uncommon energy and power to wrestle with <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    in her behalf. She soon broke out into such words as these, “what a wretch am I?” She seemed to speak out of the abundance of her heart, from a feeling sense of her own vileness. Her honoured Parent and attending servants were affected. After prayer, she seemed as though she felt things unutterable, bemoaned her ingratitude to <span
      class="smcap">God</span> and <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>;
    and I believe would gladly have given a detail of all her faults she could reckon. Her having had a form of godliness, but never having felt the power, was what she most bewailed. I left her; she continued in the same frame; and when <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> <i>S――</i>
    asked her whether she felt her heart to be as bad as
    <a id="p378"></a>she expressed herself, she answered, “yes, and worse.” At her request, some time after this, I gave her the holy communion; a communion indeed it was. Never did I see a person receive it with seemingly greater contrition, more earnest desire for pardon and reconciliation with <span
      class="smcap">God</span> through <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    or stronger purposes of devoting her future life to his service. Being weak, she was desired to keep lying on her bed. She replied, “I can rise to take my physic; shall I not rise to pray?” When I was repeating the Communion Office, she applied all to herself, and broke out frequently aloud in her applying. When I said, the burden of them is intolerable, she burst out—“yea very intolerable,” with abundance of such like expressions. When she took the bread and wine, her concern gave her utterance, and she spake like one that was ripening for heaven. Those around her wept for joy.—My cold heart also was touched, and I left her with a full persuasion, that she was either to be taken off soon, or to be a blessing here below. I think she lived about a week afterwards: she continued in the same frame as far as I hear, and I trust is now gone, where she will sing the song of <i>Moses</i> and of the Lamb for ever. The thoughts of this, comforts good Lady <i>G――</i>, and the same consideration, I am persuaded, will have the same effect upon your Ladyship. Only methinks I hear your Ladyship add, “No, I will not stop here. By divine grace I will devote myself to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    now, and give him no rest, till I see the world in that light as dear Miss <i>H――</i> did, and as I myself shall, when I come to die. I will follow my honoured mother as she follows <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    and count the Redeemer’s reproach of more value than all the honours, riches and pleasures of the world. I will fly to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    by faith, and through the help of my <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    keep up not only the form, but also the power of godliness in heart and life.” That the glorious <i>Emanuel</i> may enable your Ladyship to put all this into practice, is the earnest prayer of, Madam,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span>T would give me concern, was I to return to <i>London</i>, though from ever so short an excursion, without letting your Ladyship know that you are always remembered by me at the throne of grace. Upon such a throne the Redeemer sits, holding out his golden sceptre, and asking us, “What is your petition? And what is your request?” My request for your Ladyship is, that you may increase with all the increase of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    This I trust your Ladyship is daily doing, and consequently increasing in inward happiness, peace and joy. The riches of the divine life are indeed unsearchable. May your
    <a id="p381"></a>Ladyship dig for them as for hid treasure, till faith be turned into vision, and hope into the endless fruition of the ever blessed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    That time will shortly come. I have been labouring at <i>Birmingham</i>, in <i>Gloucestershire</i>, at <i>Nottingham</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>
    to awaken a sleepy world to a sense of it, and I trust not without success. On last <i>Thursday</i> I came here, and next <i>Monday</i>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, shall set out for <i>London</i>. Good Lady <i>H――</i> goes on acting the part of a mother in <i>Israel</i>, more and more. For a day or two she has had five clergymen under her roof, which makes her Ladyship look like a <i>good Archbishop</i> with his Chaplains around him. Her house is indeed a <i>Bethel</i>. To us in the ministry, it looks like a college. We have the Sacrament every morning, heavenly conversation all day, and preach at night. This is to <i>live at Court</i>, indeed. Last night I had the pleasure of seeing a little flock that seemed to be awakened by the grace of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    so that even out of ungrateful <i>Ashby</i>, I trust there will be raised up many children unto <i>Abraham</i>. Your Ladyship, and the other elect Ladies, are never forgotten by us. I would write to good Lady <i>F――</i>, but I hear she is out of town. That the choicest of divine blessings, even the sure mercies of <i>David</i>, may follow you both all the days of your lives, is the hearty prayer of, honoured Madam,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span>T is with great pleasure that I have heard of your Ladyship’s being so supported under your late bereavement, and of the good impressions made on surviving relations by it. Thus the Redeemer delights to magnify his strength in his people’s weakness, and causes the death of one, to be the life, as it were, the resurrection of another. O what amazing mysteries will be unfolded, when each link in the golden chain of Providence and Grace, shall be seen and scanned by beatified spirits in the kingdom of heaven! There all will appear symmetry and harmony, and even the most intricate and seemingly
    <a id="p382"></a>most contrary dispensations, will be evidenced to be the result of infinite and consummate wisdom, power, and love. Above all, there the believer will see the infinite depths of that mystery of godliness, “<span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    manifested in the flesh,” and join with that blessed choir, who with a restless unweariedness are ever singing the song of <i>Moses</i> and the Lamb. There your Ladyship I believe will see your departed daughter, not struggling with a burning fever, but burning with love extatic, and with seraphic sweetness adoring that Redeemer, who at the eleventh hour, even on a dying bed, snatched her as a brand out of the fire. But what am I doing? I fear, making your Ladyship’s wounds to bleed afresh.—But, honoured Madam, is it not a pleasant bleeding, to think of bearing children for heaven! To see those nearest and dearest parts of ourselves go before us thither—O what a favour is this! May your Ladyship be always thus highly favoured: may you live to see all your surviving children taught and born of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I must not enlarge. Neither have I room to acquaint your Ladyship, how that mirror of piety, good Lady <i>H――</i>, adorns the gospel of her <span

    in all things. I wrote some particulars of our situation to the good Countess. I can now only add, that when I come to town, your Ladyship may at any time command, honoured Madam,</p>

    <i>Ashby, <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 13, 1750.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>My very dear <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> T――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR kind letter did not reach me till about two days ago. I embrace the first opportunity of answering it. If you write often, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, you shall hear oftener from me. You are peculiarly dear to me, and therefore I heartily wish you was thrust out into our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s harvest. <i
      lang="la">Vox populi</i>, much more <i
      lang="la">vox amicorum</i>, is frequently <i
      lang="la">vox Dei</i>.
    I say to you, as a good old minister did to one whom you know, and who was as unwilling to go into the vineyard, as you can be, “I believe if <abbr
      title="Saint">St.</abbr> <i>Paul</i>
    was alive, he would ordain you.” You have a moderate share of learning, an agreeable address, a
    <a id="p383"></a>good elocution, a little knowledge of mankind, and of yourself, and above all an experimental acquaintance with the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
    with a door of usefulness immediately opening; and what would you more? I wish some latent pride may not be at the bottom. Lose no more time, my dear man. The voice of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    to you now is, “Follow me, and I will make thee a fisher of men.” The harvest is great, the labourers are few. Thousands are perishing for lack of that knowledge, which you have already. The world wants more heat than light. <i
      lang="la">Crescit eundo, crescit agendo</i>,
    is a young minister’s motto. I think the Itinerancy abroad would suit you well. By travelling before you take on you a settled charge, you will get a deeper insight into the world and the church; you will insensibly acquire larger and more sublime thoughts of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    providence and grace, and consequently be more fit to serve whatever flock the Holy Ghost shall hereafter place you over. I believe that your honoured father loves <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    too well, to stand out long against a rational scheme for the extensive usefulness of his son. He is a dear man, whom I love in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Pray remember me to him in the kindest manner, and tell him I purpose writing to him as soon as possible. This leaves me at <i>Ashby</i>, at good Lady <i>H――n</i>’s, whose house is indeed a <i>Bethel</i> to those who are willing to follow her, as she follows <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    One of high rank, I really believe, was converted lately on a dying bed, and her death I trust hath proved the life of one or two more. One of the <i>Kendal</i> converts is gone off in flying colours, and our blessed <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    has given us sweet seasons at <i>Portsmouth</i>, <i>Chatham</i>, <i>Gloucestershire</i>, <i>Birmingham</i>, <i>Eversham</i>, <i>Wednesbury</i>, <i>Nottingham</i>, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr> Next <i>Monday</i>, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I go for <i>London</i>, in order to put into winter quarters. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    prepare me for a fresh campaign! Do you know any one fit for a Tutor at <i>Georgia</i>? I am glad that <i>New Jersey</i> college succeeds. I had lately a letter from Governor <i>Belcher</i>, which I suppose you have seen; it was sent to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>N――</i>.
    Colonel <i>W――</i> proposes that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i>
    shall come over with one of the <i>Indians</i>; I wish he may. I am sorry to hear that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> ――
    is likely to destroy himself by hard study. I had rather he would kill himself with hard working, and going about to do good. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>
    seems to me to have chosen the better part. How is
    <a id="p384"></a>dear <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>R―― W――</i>? I hope he is like a flame of fire. Pray salute him and all my dear, very dear friends in the tenderest manner. I could live and die with them. In heaven we shall live together. There we shall see our dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>.
    I hope your little choir are every day learning more and more of the new song, in order to join him in the realms above.—You have all my hearty love and prayers. Accept the same yourself in a very particular manner from, very dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Had the favour of your Excellency’s letter, and took the liberty of communicating it to good Lady <i>H――n</i>, who shines in the church of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    on this side the water, as a star of the first magnitude. Her Ladyship will be very glad to open a correspondence with your Excellency; and seems to speak of <i>New-Jersey</i> College with great satisfaction. I rejoice to hear that it is in a prosperous situation. If <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>P――</i> or <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    can be prevailed on to come over, I am persuaded liberal contributions will be raised both in <i>England</i> and <i>Scotland</i>. All was ready, if dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>A――</i>
    had not been taken off by death; but even this our blessed <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    can and will over-rule for good. I think it forebodes good for <i>America</i>, that such a spirit is excited in so many provinces for promoting a learned and religious education. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    only knows how much my heart is on that side the water. I should certainly have embarked about this time, did not my wife daily expect an hour of travail. I can only say, “It is the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>;
    let him do what seemeth him good.” Blessed be his name, fresh doors for usefulness are opened every week. We had a blessed scene this Summer in <i>Scotland</i>, and ever since I have been ranging about, to see who will believe the gospel report. O that I may die in the field! I am now at my good Lady’s with three clergymen that love and preach <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Several souls have been awakened here. One of high birth was lately converted on her dying bed; and by that means I trust one or two more
    <a id="p385"></a>are put upon securing the one thing needful. On <i>Monday</i> I shall leave her Ladyship, to go for <i>London</i>, which is to be my Winter quarters. I shall long for <i>Spring</i>, that I may enter upon a fresh campaign. O that my soul may begin to spring indeed! spring for Him who was stretched upon the accursed tree to save my wretched soul. Blessed be his name, that your Excellency has got such a sweet retreat in the decline of life; where, free from noise and hurry, you and your consort may ripen for heaven, and consequently be more and more fitted for your last great change. That will now shortly come. Your Excellency is arrived to a good old age. You have by faith seen the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Christ</span>.
    You have been instrumental in founding a christian college. Let death come when it will, with good old <i>Simeon</i>, you may say, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,” for my soul hath experienced thy great salvation! This I believe, honoured Sir, is all your desire. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will grant it to you. O that when you are near his throne, you may have a petition upon your heart for unworthy, ill-deserving, hell-deserving me! Your Excellency hath laid me under many obligations; let me entreat you by the mercies of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
    to add to them by not ceasing to pray for me, that as I have had much forgiven me, I may, with <i>Magdalen</i>, love much; and being a brand plucked out of the burning, I may, in <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    own time and way, be translated to dwell with <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span> in his kingdom. As our <span

    enables, the favour shall constantly be returned in behalf of you and yours, by, honoured Sir,</p>

    <a id="p388"></a><i>John</i> has put his hand to the gospel plough, and am not without hopes that his lot will be to itinerate, at least for a while. He seems to be qualified for such an employ. I shall be glad to see him on the other side of the water. Had I the management of a thousand youths, if circumstances would allow, they should travel for one year at least, before they took upon them a settled charge. Methinks I hear you say, “What! will you take my <i>Benjamin</i> away?” This was old <i>Jacob</i>’s infirmity. You love <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    too well to refuse giving up the young lad, if it should appear in providence that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    hath need of him either at home or abroad. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to direct and bless you both, and to establish his covenant with you and your seed for ever. You are now on the decline of life. I have been just reading about the year of jubilee. How joyful were the prisoners when they heard of the approach of that wish’d-for day! How much more joyful may those be, who having an interest in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    are waiting for the last trump, to proclaim our eternal jubilee in heaven! This, my dear friend, is your happy lot. Rejoice, and again I say, rejoice. The day of our complete redemption draweth nigh. Let us then lift up our heads, and let us lift up our hearts to praise him, from whom alone cometh our salvation. I could enlarge, but am called away. My hearty love to all enquiring friends. I think to write to your son soon. We had a happy day yesterday among the Great Ones. I am, my very dear Sir,</p>

    O my soul. My disorder was a violent fever: <span

    It is enough when we come to our last moments, to have nothing to do, but to die. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that you have courage given you to speak to the dying. A word spoken in such a season how good is it? May the great physician take you under his peculiar care, forgive you all your sins, and heal all your diseases! I purpose writing to my friend <i>J―― T――</i>, and others, as I get strength.

The Reception that your Ladyship’s kind motion met with, convinces me more and more, that “Be ye warmed, and be ye filled,” without giving any thing to be warmed and filled with, is the farthest that most professors go. Words are cheap, and cost nothing; and therefore many can say, “they pity,” and that extremely too, when at the same time, their practice shews it is only a verbal, and not a real compassion. I often told the poor man, that his dependance was too strong; and that I was afraid least help would not come from that quarter where he expected most. He sends ten thousand thanks for what your Ladyship hath done already. Surely he is worthy. He is a lover of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    and his outward circumstances very pitiable indeed. Your Ladyship will not be offended at the freedom I take. You love to help the distressed to the utmost of your power; and your Ladyship shall find that good measure, pressed down and running over, shall be returned into

    <span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE I had the pleasure of your letter, I had heard some particulars of the late commotion at <i>Canterbury</i>. Ere now I hope you have been directed to the choice of such means, as may, under <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    open the door wider than ever for preaching the everlasting gospel in your parts. Satan has done at <i>Canterbury</i> as he always does elsewhere; I mean, he has overshot his mark. Such proceedings are too violent to hold long. Exhort, therefore, my dear Sir, your fellow-soldiers, to quit themselves like men, and be strong. Put ye on the whole armour of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>;
    and always remember, that through much tribulation we must enter into glory. Now is the time for you to prove the strength of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    to be yours. Your way to fight, is upon your knees. That weapon <i>all-prayer</i> will do wonders. The devil has lost some servants, and he is afraid of losing more. Therefore he rallies his forces as <i>Pharaoh</i> harnessed his chariots, and wants to bring you back to <i>Egypt</i>. Your business is to go on. Though <i>Pharaoh</i> is behind, and a red-sea before you,—ere long you shall pass through the one, and see the other totally destroyed. In patience possess ye your souls. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is able to bring the counsel of every <i>Achitophel</i> to nought. You know in whom you have believed. He never did, he never will, he never can fail those that put their trust in him. Think of those farewel words, which he spake in the days of his flesh to his dear disciples, “Let not your hearts be troubled; in the world ye shall have tribulation:—But I have overcome the world.” That is enough to raise every drooping heart. He hath overcome for us; he will overcome in us, and ere long call us to reign with him for ever in glory. O blessed hope! Whilst I am musing
    <a id="p393"></a>on it, the fire kindles. Brethren, my heart is enlarged towards you. The <span

    <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR letter came safe to hand. I pray <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    enable me to answer it agreeable to his will. Your call to enter into the ministry, seems to be pretty clear, and if your health would permit you to be a tutor, and courage be given you to act like a good soldier of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    you might do unspeakable good in residing at college. If a person’s health will not admit of such a residence, I think by the laws of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    and man, his absence may be dispensed with. Originally, <i>Fellows</i> were appointed to reside; but there is no general rule without an exception. Particular circumstances can only determine particular cases. <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    I know hath been dispensed with many years:—and though I cannot say I have approved of this part of his conduct, yet as he is called elsewhere, and applies the college income to good purposes, I suppose he thinks he acts an honest and christian part. As for the difficulties you seem to place before you, I can only say, “<i
      lang="la">Nil desperandum Christo duce.</i>”
    Every new scene brings its new temptations; but faith in the Son of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    will make us more than conquerors over all. His love shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is the best director and support in all circumstances whatsoever. For want of an establishment in this, and through the prevalency of an hypocondraical disorder, you seem to have particular scruples about particular things. It is what all persons, entering on the divine life, are more or less exposed to. “Meditation, prayer, reading, and temptation, (says holy <i>Luther</i>) make a minister.” Your levity of spirit, and fickleness of temper, are your greatest diseases. These are to be watched and prayed against, and by divine grace will be overcome. Look up, therefore, dear Sir, to the blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    Out of weakness he can and will make you
    <a id="p394"></a>to become strong, and turn your lightness of spirit into solid joy. Till then, be content rather to appear stupid, than by giving way to the luxuriancy of unsanctified wit, bring guilt upon your soul. Thus, dear Sir, I have endeavoured to answer your letter; though I must confess, as you are so near, I had rather converse with you personally. You may use freedom with me. I rejoice that the glorious <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    hath in any degree blessed my poor administrations to you. I need not, therefore, remind you to give him all the glory, and entreat you to pray for me, who am the very chief of sinners, and less than the least of all saints, but for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s sake, dear Sir,</p>

    Poor man! This is a home-stroke indeed! I hope he and his yoke-fellow will now take a large step to heaven. May <span

    prepare us, my dear friend, for the finishing trials! We must all have them in our turns. But wherefore should we fear? Out of very faithfulness, our heavenly Father causes us to be troubled. Of his infinite mercy he hath lately been pleased to visit me with a threatening illness. I was just casting anchor;—but it seems I must put out to sea again. O that it may be to direct others to the way that leads to the haven of eternal rest! Who knows but I may sound the gospel once more in <i>Scotland</i>? I have some thoughts of coming for a little while, before I embark for <i>America</i>. You will desire all the societies to pray, that the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    would order my goings in his way. I rejoice that they hold on their way. May they hold on and hold out to the end! My constant prayer for them is, that they may increase with all the increase of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Many in town have been awakened this Winter. O that I was humble! When shall that once be? O that
    <a id="p395"></a>I was thankful! Fain would I burn with love and gratitude like a seraph.</p>

    Well! Let faith and patience hold out a little longer, and all will be well. He is faithful, who hath promised, who also will do it. Believers should look more to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    It is the only way to keep their hands from hanging down, and to strengthen their feeble knees. Exhort all to this: and pray salute every enquiring friend, every member of the societies, in the most endearing manner; for indeed I love my <i>Scotch</i> friends in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Whilst I am writing to and thinking of them, tears, but tears of love, are ready to gush from mine eyes. O that I may meet them all in the kingdom of our Father! O that their lamps may be always trimmed, and their loins girt! Behold <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    comes quickly, and his reward is with him: let us not leave him. Let us not flag in the latter stages of our road. O our bleeding, agonizing, dying <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    how have we pierced thee! At least how have I! O that we may look and love, look and mourn, even as one that mourneth for a first-born or an only son. Dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>B――</i>
    can now comment on this text. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    comfort his heart, and be better to him than seven sons! I can no more. Affections of various kinds quite overflow. I long to begin to do something for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    A sense of my vileness and unfruitfulness, quite breaks my heart. Surely I shall sing, free grace in heaven.—I write this to you as a friend. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    be with you, and reward you and all, for their sympathy with me and mine. Fail not to pray for me; and believe me to be, my very dear <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">I</span>T is high time to answer your kind letter. I am doing it at <i>Ashby</i>, whither I rid post, not knowing whether I should see good Lady <i>H――n</i> alive. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, she is somewhat
    <a id="p396"></a>better, and I trust will not yet die, but live and abound more and more in the work of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    Entreat all our friends to pray for her. Indeed she is worthy. Her sister-in-law, Lady <i>Frances H――</i>, lies dead in the house. She was a retired christian, lived silently, and died suddenly without a groan. May my exit be like hers! Whether right or not, I cannot help wishing that I may go off in the same manner. To me it is worse than death, to live to be nursed, and see friends weeping about one. Sudden death, is sudden glory. Methinks it is falling a sleep indeed, or rather a translation. But all this must be left to our heavenly Father. He knows what is best for us and others. Let it be our care to have all things ready. Let the house of our hearts, and our temporal affairs be put in order immediately, that we may have nothing to do but to obey the summons, though it should be at evening, cock-crowing, or in the morning. Physicians that are always attending on the dying, one would imagine should in a peculiar manner learn to die daily. May this be your daily employ! I believe it is; though, like me, you must complain that the old man dies hard. Well, has he got his deadly blow? Die then he shall, even that death to which he put our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    O that the language of our hearts may always be, “Crucify, crucify him.” This is painful. But the Redeemer can help us to bear it.</p>

    <i>Honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">L</span>AST <i>Monday</i> evening, through the goodness of an ever-blessed Redeemer, I got safe to <i>Ashby</i>, where I found good Lady <i>H――n</i> very sick, though I trust not unto death. All advise her Ladyship to take a journey to <i>Bristol</i>, for the benefit of the waters, which her Ladyship seems determined to do. The death of Lady <i>Frances</i>, has not affected her Ladyship so as to hurt her. She rejoices at the thoughts of her sister’s being so quickly translated out of this house of bondage, into the glorious liberty of the sons of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Her death was a translation indeed. Her Ladyship died without a groan. She seemed as it were to smile at death; and may be said, I trust, truly “to fall asleep in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.”
    Ere long, she and all that sleep in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    shall come with him. I hope it hath been a purging time in this family. Almost all have been sick in their turns. Lady <i>Selina</i> has had a fever, but is better. Lady <i>Betty</i> is more affected than ever I saw her. A letter now from one of the young ladies, I hope would do service. Lady <i>Ann</i> bears up pretty well, but Miss <i>W――r</i> is inconsolable. It is a house of mourning; that is better than a house of feasting. The corpse is to be interred on <i>Friday</i> evening. May all that follow it, look and learn! I mean, learn to live, and learn to die. This is a lesson which you and yours, honoured Madam, I trust are learning every day. We had need be careful to get our lesson perfect, since we know not when the Son of Man will come, whether at evening,—cock-crowing,—or in the morning. To be ready at that hour, is all in all. Good Lady <i>H――n</i> sends her sincerest compliments. If any thing extraordinary happens before my return, your Ladyship shall hear again from, honoured Madam,</p>

    Why will you not shake off your chains? Why will you be stricken any more? You must come back, or be undone for ever. What have you gained by running from your father’s house? His servants have bread enough, whilst you are perishing with hunger. Say, say, I pray you, without delay, “I will arise and go to my Father.” His love keeps you uneasy; his love hedges up your way; his love follows and pursues you with this mighty famine. The language of all is, “Give me thy heart.” Be content to become a fool for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake. Your body as well as soul, will suffer even in this world, if you do not comply. You are half dead already. Faith in <span

      class="smcap">God</span>

    love so constrain you, that you may never rest till you find solid rest in him! Good Lady <i>H――n</i> is gone to take the air. Your message shall be delivered. She is but poorly; and my wife writes me word, that she is exceeding bad. This must hasten my remove from hence. I insist upon <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――ly</i>’s
    coming directly to <i>Ashby</i>, if he has any regard for good Lady <i>H――n</i>. She ought always to have a christian friend with her. That you may have a feeling possession of <span

    <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>ESTERDAY I saw your letter to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>V――</i>,
    which made me to think a line would not altogether be unacceptable to you. And what shall I say? Your case is affecting. O that your present confinement may be sanctified to the setting of your imprisoned soul at liberty, and bringing you home (after having so long fed on husks with swine) to feed upon the fatted calf! You know the father’s behaviour to the returning prodigal. He saw him when he was yet a great way off.—He ran towards him,—filthy as he was, he fell upon his neck, and kissed him. Thus, if you resolve with the prodigal, to arise and go to your Father, will the ever-blessed <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    deal with you. He will embrace you in the arms of his love; he will also cloathe you with the righteousness of his dear Son, and cause joy to be in heaven even over you, on repenting and returning to him. Is not this enough to encourage you to lay hold on his golden sceptre? to resolve, in divine strength, to mortify and bid adieu to all those sins, by which you have dishonoured your glorious Maker? You see, Sir, what wages Satan gives; <i>death</i> even in this world, and alas! <i>eternal death</i> in the world to come. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    keep you from this second death, and then temporal shame will be but little. The way you know; <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    is the way, the truth, and the life. He is mighty, and willing to save to the uttermost all that come to the Father in and through him. Come then, dear Sir, and throw yourself at the feet of his mercy. He will not only pardon, but abundantly pardon you. In <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>
    there is a fountain opened for sin and for all uncleanness. “Wash ye, make ye clean,” is the call of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to all, and now the particular call of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    to you. May the Spirit of the ever-loving, ever-lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    bring it home to your soul, and make it effectual to your thorough conversion! Let this be your sole care. For this and this only is the one thing needful. As for seeing <abbr
      title="Missus">Mrs.</abbr> ――,
    if I was to advise (as it hath been hitherto deferred) I would have you both decline it a little longer. Wait and see the issue of your trial;
    <a id="p400"></a>she can do you no good, and by coming may do herself harm. But this is a tender point. May Providence point out what is best! If we acknowledge the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    we have a promise, “that he will direct us in all our ways.” I commend you to his never-failing mercy, and beg you to accept this from, dear Sir,</p>

    of all lords will at length answer the prayers of his people, and raise you up to the joy of many souls. It would rejoice your Ladyship much to see what has been doing here. I have not known a more considerable awakening for a long time. The <span

    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR acknowledgment for my poor present, is more than it deserved. If it is made of use to your precious soul, I have my desired end. My heart’s desire and prayer to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is, that his goodness may lead you to a thorough repentance, and that you may have no rest, till you truly believe on <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.
    Reformation is not renovation: and unless the heart be totally and thoroughly changed, when the fear of hell and other outward restraints are gone, good impressions will gradually wear off, and the seeming convert return again to folly. The love of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    therefore constrains me, dear Sir, to exhort you to make thorough work of it, and to give all diligence to make your calling and election sure. Now indeed is the accepted time! Surely you may say, “Am I not a brand plucked out of the burning?” Satan will not care that you should leave him without some attacks. When you are abroad, old habits, and old corruptions will strive to renew their ancient acquaintance with you: merry company will endeavour to redebauch you, and your grand adversary the devil will labour to render all the amazing mercies you have received, fruitless and abortive.—Be upon your guard. Distrust yourself. Be instant in prayer. Look continually to <span

    and then as your day is, so shall your strength be. Be pleased to accept this in love. If I may judge of your aspect and letter, you will.

I ventured the other day to put out a guinea to interest for you. It was to release an excellent christian, who by living very hard, and working near twenty hours out of four-and-twenty, had brought himself very low. He has a wife and four children, and was above two guineas in debt. I gave one for myself and one for you. We shall have good interest for our money in another world. O for a mind like his, who though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might become rich! I have been recommending him this morning, and purpose doing so again this evening. In <i>Gloucestershire</i> the word hath been gladly received, and here we have had pleasant gales.

  <p>
    <i>Reverend and very dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Lately received your last kind letter, and am glad to find that you are enabled to joy in tribulation, and to say, “Father, not my will, but thine be done.” May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    increase your faith, and if you should be called to give up your <i>Isaac</i>, your dear yoke-fellow, may you, <i>Aaron</i> like, hold your peace, and by an undissembled resignation to the divine will, glorify your <span
      class="smcap">God</span>!
    My wife has been in pitiable circumstances for some time. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    only knows what will be the issue of them. This is my comfort, “all things work together for good to those that love <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.”
    He is the father of mercies, and the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of all consolation. He can bring light out of darkness, and cause the barren wilderness to smile. This I trust will be verified in <i>Georgia</i>. Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that the time for favouring that Colony seems to be come. I think now is the season for us to exert our utmost for the good of the poor <i>Ethiopians</i>. We are told, that even they are soon to stretch out their hands unto <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    And who knows but their being settled in <i>Georgia</i>, may be over-ruled for this great end? As for the lawfulness of keeping slaves, I have no doubt, since I hear of some that were bought with <i>Abraham</i>’s money, and some that were born in his house.—And I cannot help thinking, that some of those servants mentioned by the Apostles in their epistles were or had been slaves. It is plain, that the <i>Gibeonites</i> were doomed to perpetual slavery, though liberty is a sweet thing to such as are born free, yet to those who never <a
      id="p404a" href="#n_22">♦</a>knew
    the sweets of it, slavery perhaps may not be so irksome. However this be, it is plain to a demonstration, that hot countries cannot be cultivated without negroes. What a flourishing country might <i>Georgia</i> have been, had the use of them been permitted years ago? How many white people have been destroyed for want of them, and how many thousands of pounds spent to no purpose at all? Had <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Henry</i>
    been in <i>America</i>, I believe he would have seen the lawfulness and necessity of having negroes there. And though it is true, that they are brought in a wrong way from
    <a id="p405"></a>their own country, and it is a trade not to be approved of, yet as it will be carried on whether we will or not; I should think myself highly favoured if I could purchase a good number of them, in order to make their lives comfortable, and lay a foundation for breeding up their posterity in the nurture and admonition of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    You know, dear Sir, that I had no hand in bringing them into <i>Georgia</i>; though my judgment was for it, and so much money was yearly spent to no purpose, and I was strongly importuned thereto, yet I would not have a negro upon my plantation, till the use of them was publicly allowed in the colony. Now this is done, dear Sir, let us reason no more about it, but diligently improve the present opportunity for their instruction. The trustees favour it, and we may never have a like prospect. It rejoiced my soul, to hear that one of my poor negroes in <i>Carolina</i> was made a brother in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    How know we but we may have many such instances in <i>Georgia</i> ere it be long? By mixing with your people, I trust many of them will be brought to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    and this consideration, as to us, swallows up all temporal inconveniencies whatsoever. Thus, my dear Sir, I have opened my mind to you on this head; if it satisfies you, I shall be glad; though I suppose what holy <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Z――n</i>
    has already written, has been sufficient. His heart seems touched with a sympathy for these poor creatures, and in the fall, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I intend seeing what can be done towards laying a foundation. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    prosper this work of our hands upon us, prosper thou, O <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,

    The waters agree with her wonderfully already, and I trust she will be restored to perfect health. As dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    cannot be prevailed upon to come down, if it would any way suit you to be with her Ladyship a month, it would much refresh her, and I believe be very agreeable to you. Some pulpits would be open for you, and who knows but you might catch some great fish in the gospel net? But I need not enforce this, since her Ladyship hath written to you herself. May the blessed Redeemer direct your going in his way! Put up the same request for me. I have thoughts of going to <i>Wales</i>, <i>Ireland</i> and <i>Scotland</i>. We have had good seasons in <i>Gloucestershire</i>, and at <i>Bristol</i>, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    enabled me to sow some gospel seed at <i>Taunton</i> and <i>Wellington</i> in my way hither. O that ever such a wretch as I should be thus honoured!</p>

    <i>Plymouth, March 30, 1751.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR letter came safe to hand in due season, but I have been straitened how to answer it. I would write as I preach; I mean I would speak the truth as it is in <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    without endeavouring to blacken any denomination whatsoever. I think <i>Gamaliel</i>’s advice is good at all times, and in all ages, and our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    promise will be fulfilled, “That every plant that our heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.” This makes me to bear and forbear with many who widely differ from me both in principles and practice. This, as you observe, dear Sir, you may know by my poor discourses, and I find as yet no reason to alter my sentiments. I doubt not but there are many holy souls among the <i>M――s</i>; but their not preaching the law, either as a <i>Schoolmaster</i> to shew us the need of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    or as a <i>rule of life</i> after we have closed with him, is what I can in no wise concur with. These seem to be two grand mistakes, and which with their various unscriptural expressions in their hymns, and several superstitious fopperies lately intruded among them, make me to think, they are sadly departed from the simplicity of the gospel. But to their own master they stand or fall. <i
      lang="la">Exitus acta probat.</i>
    My prayer for myself and all <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s children is, “<span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    rectify all that is wrong, and bless and prosper all that is right!” I bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    dear Sir, that you are appearing valiant for the truth. You will find more and more by happy experience, that to him that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    never sends a person on a warfare at his own charges. Do not despair of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>G――</i>. As the love of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    comes in, the fear of man goes out. By and by I trust he will set his face on a flint. It is high time for some to appear for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    What pain did he endure? What shame did he suffer for us? Strange! that we should be so unwilling to go without the camp, to share with Him in his sacred reproach. Alas, what cowards are we! Dear Sir, let us pray for each other, that we may be strong in the grace which is in the <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
    and never fear what men and devils can say, or do unto us.
    <a id="p408"></a><span class="smcap">Christ</span> is worth all, or he is worth nothing. I thank you for your invitation in his great name. If providence should bring me into the North, I hope to wait upon you. At present, I am bound for <i>Wales</i>. I have good news from abroad, and I believe the work is upon the advance at home. That you may be abundantly blessed, is the earnest prayer of, dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Was pleased last night to find by my wife’s letters, that your sister was delivered, and more so, because my wife wrote as though you was again under my roof. This I count a great honour, and such a privilege, that I wish to have the favour conferred on me as long as I live. These my hands (could they work, and was there occasion for it,) should readily minister to your necessities. If my wife should come down to <i>Bristol</i>, pray let not my dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>H――</i>
    move. If <i>Molly</i> stays in <i>London</i>, she will take care of you; if not, <i>Polly</i> and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>D――n</i>
    will gladly wait upon you. As I have been under some trying exercises for this month past, I have often wished to see you. But my blessed master hath given me access to himself, and he will make me more then conqueror through his love. I find <i>Luther</i>’s words truly applicable to myself, “He was never employed about any fresh work, but he was either visited with a fit of sickness or some violent temptations.” Some good I trust is to be done this Spring to many souls. This Western circuit I believe hath been blessed already. I have preached about forty times since I left <i>London</i>, and have been enabled several times to ride forty miles in a day. I find that this sensibly refreshes me. I wish you could say so too;—your <i>Biddeford</i> friends would then see you.—They hold on their way, and long to have a line from you. Old <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    is dead. I providentially met <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>T――</i>
    at his son’s house. At <i>Plymouth</i> we had sweet seasons, and on <i>Tuesday</i> last I met with a young clergyman
    <a id="p409"></a>who was awakened under my preaching seven years ago. He hath been at <i>Cambridge</i>, and was ordained last Lent by the bishop of <i>Exeter</i>. He is followed much, and I suppose will soon be reproached for his master’s sake. What cannot <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    do? I hope you find that he gives you strength to proceed in your book. It is enquired much after. The <span

    be with you, and bless your pen, and your heart. I send my hearty love to your brother and whole houshold, and am, very dear <abbr

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Fully proposed to have written to you from <i>Wales</i>, but was prevented by travelling and preaching. In about three weeks, I rode perhaps above five hundred miles, and preached generally twice a day. Congregations were as large as usual, and I trust an unusual power accompanied the word. After being about five days on the water, I arrived here the <abbr

      class="smcap">Lord</span>’s
    day upwards of ten thousand attended. It much resembled a <i>Moor-fields</i> auditory. Next <i>Monday</i>, <span

    I now lodge at a banker’s, who purposes to come to <i>London</i> shortly. He is a follower of <span

Every day I can sympathise with your Ladyship. As the weather grows warmer, my body grows weaker, and my vomitings follow me continually. But all is little enough to keep me down, and prepare me for the service in which I am engaged. My last from <i>Dublin</i>, acquainted your Ladyship of my being owned of <span

    I am informed, that <i>Dublin</i> is in a ferment, and that my hearers will be much more numerous at my return. Oh the blessedness of leaving all for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>!
    For this week past, I have been preaching twice almost every day in some country towns, and yesterday I sounded the gospel trumpet here. Every where, there seems to be a stirring among the dry bones, and the trembling lamps of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    people have been supplied with fresh oil. I find, through the many offences that have lately been given, matters were brought to a low ebb. But the cry now is, “Methodism is revived again.”—Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that I have an opportunity of shewing my disinterestedness, and that I preach not for a party of my own, but for the common interest of my blessed master. May he keep me thus minded, and then I am sure all will go well at last. Your Ladyship would smile, to see how the wise have been catched in their own craftiness. O that this good news from a far country may prove a cordial to your Ladyship’s soul! I pity your solitary state. I pity the deadness of all around you; but your Ladyship knows, whose brethren did not believe on him; it was even that <span
      class="smcap">God</span>-man,
    who spoke a parable for this end, that men ought always to pray and not to faint. Happy trials, that drive us to our knees. Ever-honoured Madam, I could enlarge, but must not. Your Ladyship shall hear, <span

I should have been heartily glad to have heard from or seen you, but I trust, honoured Sir, you will have a heart given you to pray for me, and then, one way or another, my way will be made plain before me. Hitherto (thanks be to his free grace) my master supports and comforts me. He administers seed to the sower, and as far as I can hear, blesses it when sown. O that his mercies humbled me! O that I may never provoke him to leave me, or lay me aside! Some dreadful offences have been given in <i>Ireland</i>, but I trust all will work for good. My coming was very opportune and providential. May I learn to follow the Lamb blindfold, whithersoever he shall be pleased to lead me!

    will speak for us. One to whom I had been represented in black colours, writes thus from <i>Dublin</i> to a preacher in <i>Cork</i>,—“What blessed seasons have we had since <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Whitefield</i>
    came,—his coming hath been unspeakably blest to many. Thousands constantly attended the word. His word is attended with power. I never heard a man preach holiness of heart in a clearer manner.—He powerfully preaches <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    for us and in us. I confess I had strange ideas about him, but blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, I have not now. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    be praised that ever I saw his face, <abbr
      title="and so on">&amp;c.</abbr>――”
    Thus it hath been elsewhere. O that I was humble! O that I was thankful! Not unto me, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    not unto me, but to thy free unmerited grace be all the glory?—May I learn more and more to leave all to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, even a <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>!
    If his cause be promoted, my end is answered. Let souls go where they please to hear, and welcome. Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    for giving your Ladyship a disinterested catholic spirit. However afflicted, and in pain on earth, you shall shine ere long in the kingdom of heaven. <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    hath prepared a place for you, and is daily and hourly preparing your Ladyship for the place. I am glad you are like to have some company. I beg that my most hearty respects and acknowledgments may find acceptance with them and good Lady <i>H――</i>. I hope the waters will agree with the young Ladies. Above all, I pray that they, and the whole circle of your Ladyship’s relations and friends, may drink
    <a id="p415"></a>plentifully of that water, whose streams refresh the city of <span

  <p>
    <i>Dear <abbr title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> T――</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">V</span>ERY providentially, your kind letter reached me this morning. As I am detained by the importunity of the people, I must snatch a few moments to answer it. Thanks be to the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords, if my poor administrations have been any ways blessed, either to you or others. “Not unto me, not unto me, but unto thy free and unmerited grace, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>, be all the glory!” Preaching <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    I find to be the best means of winning sinners, and of building up saints. This done with a single eye and disinterested heart, will make its way through all opposition, and stand fast, when all other schemes built on a legal bottom and supported by low politics, will fall to the ground. I wish you may have grace given you to act aright in your present circumstances. Let all bitterness and wrath and clamour be put away from you. Go on simply preaching the everlasting gospel; and if rejected for that, and freely discharged from your present connection, I shall do all in my power to promote your usefulness. I suppose, you will hear from other hands what hath been doing in <i>Dublin</i>. I hope the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    of all Lords hath been with us. Thousands flock in this place also, to hear the word preached. I thought to have left <i>Belfast</i> to-day, but have complied with the people’s earnest requests, to continue in these parts till <i>Monday</i>. O for a pilgrim heart with my pilgrim life! At present, I have no thoughts of nestling. Fain would I be kept from flagging in the latter stages of my road. I beg the continuance of your prayers. My prayer to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for you and yours is, “that you may live together as heirs of the grace of life, and walk in all the ordinances and commandments of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    blameless.” You are entered upon a new scene, and will require more
    <a id="p416"></a>grace to act your parts well, than at present you may be aware of: But there is an all-sufficiency in <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    who hath promised, that as our day is, so our strength shall be. I commend you and yours, and all the followers of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>,
    to his never-failing mercy, and subscribe myself, for his great name’s sake, dear Sir,</p>

On <i>Wednesday</i> evening I came hither, and intended to embark immediately for <i>Scotland</i>, but the people by their importunity prevailed on me to stay. In about an hour’s time, thousands were gathered to hear the word. I preached morning and evening, and since that have preached at <i>Lisburn</i>, <i>Lurgun</i>, the <i>Maize</i>, and <i>Lambag</i>, towns and places adjacent. So many attend, and the prospect of doing good is so promising, that I am grieved I came to the north no sooner. The country round about is like <i>Yorkshire</i> in <i>England</i>, and quite different from the most southern parts of <i>Ireland</i>. I am now waiting for a passage to <i>Scotland</i>, which I hope to get either to-morrow or on <i>Tuesday</i>. From thence your Ladyship shall hear from me again; in the mean while, having preached to many thousands again this morning, I must content myself with praying, that the best of blessings may descend on your Ladyship, and subscribe myself, ever-honoured Madam,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Think it long ere I send your Ladyship another letter.—My last was from <i>Belfast</i>, where I preached twice on yesterday sevennight, and immediately after took shipping and arrived the next evening at <i>Erwin</i>. On <i>Wednesday</i> morning, at the desire of the magistrates, I preached to a great congregation, and ever since have been preaching twice every day in
    <a id="p418"></a>this city. Thousands attend every morning and evening. They seem never to be weary, and I am more followed than ever. Though I preached near eighty times in <i>Ireland</i>, and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    was pleased to bless his word, yet <i>Scotland</i> seems to be a new world to me. To see the people bring so many bibles, turn to every passage, when I am expounding, and hang as it were upon me to hear every word, is very encouraging. I feel uncommon freedom of heart here, and talking with the winter, as well as summer saints, feeds and delights my heart. My body is kept pretty healthy, and my voice greatly strengthened, so that I think <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    is preparing me for more work, or that some trial is at hand. This I suppose will find your Ladyship yet in the furnace, but <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is in the midst of the bush, and in the fiery furnace too; he will quench the violence of the flames, or cause the fire of his love to burn higher. I could enlarge, but am straitened. Some ministers wait for me. Your Ladyship would be delighted with our morning and evening auditories. This day in the church we have had a blessed feast. To-morrow I take my leave, and then for <i>Edinburgh</i>. There I expect to stay near a fortnight. Glad shall I be to hear of your Ladyship’s welfare.

    <i>Edinburgh, July 29, 1751.</i></p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HROUGH the tender mercies of a never-failing Redeemer, I came here safe yesterday noon. In the evening, and this morning, I preached the everlasting gospel to thronged auditories, and met with a very kind reception from my friends. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> make me humble, <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    make me truly thankful! As his interest seems to be concerned, and the King’s business requires haste, I take this first opportunity of writing about the <i>Virginia</i> affair. In that province, there has been for some years past, a great awakening, especially in <i>Hanover</i> county, and the <a
      id="p418b" href="#n_24">♦</a>counties
    adjacent. As the ministers
    <a id="p419"></a>of the establishment did not favour the work, and the first awakened persons put themselves under the care of the <i>New-York</i> synod, the poor people were from time to time fined, and very much harrassed for not attending on the church service:—And as the awakening was supposed to be begun by the reading of my books, at the instigation of the council a proclamation was issued out to prohibit itinerant preaching. However, before I left <i>Virginia</i>, one <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>D――</i>
    (an excellent young man) was licensed, and settled over a congregation. Since that, the awakening has increased, so that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>D――</i>
    writes, “that one congregation is multiplied to seven.” He desires liberty to license more houses, and to preach occasionally to all, as there is no minister but himself. This, though allowed of in <i>England</i>, is denied in <i>Virginia</i>, which grieves the people very much. The commissary is one of the council, and with the rest of his brethren, I believe no friend to the Dissenters. The late Lieutenant-Governor was like-minded.—I therefore think that <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>D――</i>
    is raised up to succeed him, in order to befriend the church of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, and the interest of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    people. They desire no other privileges than what dissenting protestants enjoy in our native country. This I am persuaded your brother-in-law will be glad to secure to them. I shall write to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>D――</i>
    to wait upon his Honour immediately after his arrival. I pray the <span
      class="smcap">God</span> of the sea, and the <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    of the dry land, to send him a safe and speedy passage, and make him a long and great blessing to the inhabitants of <i>Virginia</i>. You may improve these hints as you please. I beg the prayers both of yourself and dear yoke-fellow, and assure you, that neither you nor yours are forgotten by, reverend and dear Sir,</p>

      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I found the Orphan-house in as good a situation as could be expected. The children have much improved in their learning; and I hope a foundation is now laid for a future useful seminary. I want to know what answer <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>’s
    hath given. I expect letters by <i>C――</i>, when I go to <i>Charles-town</i> next month. I was there about ten days ago, and had some close talk with <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>, and several of <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>’s
    congregation, concerning you. All seemed to be unanimous,
    <a id="p425"></a>in giving you a call. I need only observe, that if <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    should direct your course to them, you will find a generous, loving people, who will study to make your labours profitable and delightful to you. I doubt not but in the congregation there are many dear children of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    And as there will be such an harmony between you and <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>,
    I hope you will be an happy instrument of promoting peace between all parties, and adding such to the church as shall be finally saved. Very near you, are several pious ministers of other denominations, who will be glad to keep up a christian correspondence with you, and strengthen your hands in the work of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    As far as I can judge of your disposition, and all other concurring circumstances, your situation will be very agreeable to others, and to yourself. However, a trial can do no hurt to either side. A voyage to sea, and the seeing and conversing with many of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    people and ministers on this side the water, will make it worth your while to leave your native country. Travelling improved, will enlarge your ideas, and promote your future usefulness. May the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> direct your goings in his way! If it should appear to be the divine will that you should come over to <i>Charles-Town</i>, I am persuaded, the good old man your father will chearfully let his <i>Benjamin</i> go; and he will find his blessed Master to be better to him than seven sons. Pray salute him and all dear friends in the kindest manner. I would write to many, but as yet have not time. Brethren, pray for us. My very dear friend,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">A</span>S I love you most tenderly in the bowels of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>,
    you may easily guess, what great pleasure both your kind letters gave me. They came attended with a great blessing, and knit my heart, if possible, nearer to you than ever. Part of the first, indeed, I mean that which respected the Tabernacle-house, gave me uneasiness; but your last removed it, and made me thankful to our common Redeemer, who in spite of all opposition, I find will cause his word to run and be glorified. Poor <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>W――</i>
    is striving against the stream; strong assertions will not go for proofs, with those who are acquainted with the divine life, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit even to the day of redemption. They know, that their stock is now put into safe hands; that the covenant of grace is not built upon the faithfulness of a poor fallible, changeable creature, but upon the never-failing faithfulness of an unchangeable <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    This is the foundation whereon I build. “<span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,
    I believe, help my unbelief! Having once loved me, thou wilt love me to the end; thou wilt keep that safe, which I have committed unto thee: establish thy people more and more in this glorious truth; and grant that it may have this blessed effect upon us all, that we may love thee more, and serve thee better!” All truths, unless productive of holiness and love, are of no avail. They may float upon the surface of the understanding; but this is to no purpose, unless they transform the heart. This, I trust, the dear Tabernacle preachers and people will always have deeply impressed upon their minds. Let us not dispute, but love. Truth is great, and will prevail. I am quite willing that all our hearers shall hear for themselves. The Spirit of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>
    is a Spirit of liberty. You remember what I have often told you about <i>Calvin</i>. He was turned out of <i>Geneva</i> for several years; but in less than twelve years time they wished for their <i>Calvin</i> again. But what is <i>Calvin</i>, or what is <i>Luther</i>? Let us look above names and parties; let <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    the ever-loving, the ever-lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    be our all in all.—So that
    <a id="p429"></a>he be preached, and his divine image stamped more and more upon people’s souls, I care not who is uppermost. I know my place, (<span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    enable me to keep it!) even to be the servant of all. I want not to have a people called after my name, and therefore I act as I do. The cause is <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s,
    and he will take care of it. I rejoice that you go on so well at the Tabernacle. May the shout of a king be always in the midst of you, and the glory of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    be your reward. I am apt to believe you will pray me over. But future things belong to him, whose I am, and whom I endeavour to serve. After one more trip to the Orphan-house, I purpose going to the <i>Northward</i>, where I expect more letters by Captain <i>Grant</i>. Thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    all is well at <i>Bethesda</i>. A most excellent tract of land is granted to me very near the house, which in a few years I hope will make a sufficient provision for it. Pray give my tenderest and most hearty love to all your dear family, and all the Tabernacle people, and all enquiring friends. Entreat them, I pray you, to be mindful of a poor pilgrim, who night and day is never unmindful of you or them. Doctor <i>Doddridge</i> I find is gone; <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    prepare me to follow after!—With real and great affection, I subscribe myself, very dear <i>Jemmy</i>,</p>

    it begins to smile. You will see by the inclosed, what a prospect I have of providing for <i>Bethesda</i>’s future support. The letter was sent me by <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>J―― B――</i>,
    a worthy christian planter, who is lately come from <i>Carolina</i> to settle in <i>Georgia</i>. He was
    <a id="p431"></a>awakened at the Orphan-house about ten years ago. At <i>Midsummer</i>, <i>Georgia</i> is to be taken into the Government’s hands. It will then be put on the same footing with the other provinces; and in all probability will be a flourishing province. I am come in the very best time. O what a blessed thing is it to follow <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    blindfold! He hath enabled me once more to take the field. The fields seem as white as ever; and I never saw the Tabernacle so well attended. If <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    should so direct me, would the middle of <i>August</i> not be too late to come to <i>Edinburgh</i>? I cannot well come before. Does <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>R――</i>
    go directly for <i>Charles-Town</i>? How will he be paid for the Ossnaburghs he was so kind as to send over? I would fain send a few letters by him. My hearty love to him and his. Ten thousand thanks to you, for caring so friendly for my dear wife in my absence.—The <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    will care for you and my other kind friends. She is pretty well, and joins in sending cordial respects and thanks.—My young man returns his. Letters from those you mention, will be very acceptable. I hope to write to several shortly. I must now away; but not before I have wished <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>Gillespie</i>
    joy. The Pope I find has turned Presbyterian. O this power, when got into wrong hands, what mischief does it occasion! “The <span

    and her own heart. She got up early, and came after me and my wife to Madam <i>T――</i>’s. You know how to improve this hint at a proper season.

You know, my dear friend, that I hate to head a party, and that it is absolutely inconsistent with my other business, to take upon me the care of societies in various parts. I therefore cannot promise
    <a id="p434"></a>to come to <i>Ireland</i> for that purpose, neither do I ever intend to engage in building any houses. My intention is to come your way, but whether it will be this summer or not I cannot tell. <abbr

    direct you how to act, so as most to promote his glory, and the good of souls.—I hope you will all, if possible, avoid the very appearance of a party spirit, and evidence to the world, that the principles we hold are indeed of <span

Let not what has happened, draw off your mind from the Captain of your salvation. He is altogether lovely, and worthy of your highest regard. But alas! All his servants, even the best of them, are but weak fallible men at the best. Happy they, who by seeing the imperfections of the creature, are led to adhere more closely to

    <i>My very dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE I wrote my last, I have been off my horse but one day. The glorious <i>Emmanuel</i> hath carried me through the <i>Welch</i> circuit in peace and comfort. In the fortnight past, from my leaving this place, I preached twenty times, and have travelled above three hundred miles. Congregations were very large. Last Lord’s day was a high day indeed; the number of hearers at seven in the morning, as well as in the evening, at <i>Haverford-west</i>, was almost incredible. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was in the midst of them. My body was weak in speaking to them, but <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    hath strengthened me again. O that I was humble and thankful! In my way hither, we held an association; there were present about nine clergy, and near forty other labourers. I trust all are born of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    and desirous to promote his glory, and his people’s good. All was harmony and love. Yesterday I came here. It is fair time, and to-morrow, <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, I purpose to expose the gospel wine and milk to sale. This I have been doing this morning. O that the hearers may be made to come down to the price, and willing to be saved by grace:—<span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    knows I have nothing else to depend upon.</p>

Last Lord’s day I preached twice at <i>Lutterworth</i>, the famous <i>John Wicliffe</i>’s parish, and have since received a letter giving me an account of the Redeemer’s blessing my poor labours. On the <i>Monday</i>, I began in the name of the almighty husbandman, to plow up some fallow ground at <i>Leicester</i>; several thousands attended, and some endeavoured to disturb us, but the opposition was nothing like what I expected. In the evening all was hushed, and I trust our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    left a blessing behind us. In my way to <i>Lutterworth</i>, my heart was encouraged by the coming of a young man, who had been awakened under my preaching about four years ago at <i>Oulney</i>. He was before that time a bitter scoffer, but hath now been a student for a year and a half under Doctor <i>Doddridge</i>, and I believe will be admitted into the <i>London</i> academy. You may know more of him hereafter. Is not this as much as to say, “Go forwards.—In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening with-hold not thy hand, since though knowest not which may prosper, this or that.” Yes, my blessed <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
    through thy grace strengthening me, I will continue to go out into the highways and hedges; only vouchsafe to uphold me with thy right hand, and keep me from flagging in the latter stages of my road. I know you will say, <i>Amen</i> and <i>Amen</i>. This will increase my obligations, which are already more than I can express. <span

This is bitter, but wholsome physic. The all-wise physician I trust will make us drink it, till every evil, fretful, and uneasy temper be purged out of us. Let us then, my dear man, chearfully take the cup out of his blessed hands, and leave all to Him. A word to the wise is enough. I must not enlarge. How goes on brother <i>W――b</i>? I hope he does not preach in a controversial way; I suppose I shall see him in the North. My stay in <i>Scotland</i> will be about a month. You may direct for me at <i>Edinburgh</i>. I hope that a door is opened at <i>Leicester</i> and <i>Lutterworth</i> for field-preaching. We have had glorious seasons in <i>Gloucestershire</i> and <i>London</i>. O for a good gate in the North!

Not want of love, but opportunity. For this fortnight last past, I have been preaching twice every day at <i>Edinburgh</i>, where a great multitude, as well of polite as common sort of people, attended continually. I wondered they were not wearied, but the more they heard, the more they seemed desirous of hearing. Many young ministers and students were close attendants, and I trust through grace good has been done. I expected to have left <i>Scotland</i> as last <i>Tuesday</i>, but through the importunity of friends have been prevailed on to come to <i>Glasgow</i>, and shall not return for <i>England</i> till <i>Tuesday</i> sevennight. Then I hope to begin to preach my way up to <i>London</i>. In this blessed delightful work, I hope to live and die; I think it is worth dying for. The <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    make me sensible of the honour put upon me, and lay me lower at his feet every day, every hour, and every moment! I have here a flaming minister that is my friend, and I hear sweet work is going on in the highlands. Praise the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    O our souls! Inclosed you have a letter from the young student mentioned in my last. I think it is a pity that such a youth, when pious students are so much wanting, should go back to business for want of a little help. I doubt not but the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will provide for him some way or other. He generally brings those low, whom he intends to exalt, and make use of. I have glad tidings from <i>Newcastle</i> and <i>Leicester</i>. Methinks every thing concurs to bid me go out into the highways and hedges.</p>

As soon as they are put into my hands, I intend to send you copies of two letters from a High-land schoolmaster, who is honoured of <span

    shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost, is indeed all in all; this is glory begun; this is the opening of the kingdom of heaven in the soul; this is a never-failing well of water, which will at last spring up to life eternal. And yet all this is the gift, the free gift of <span
      class="smcap">God</span> in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.
    It cost him dearly, even his own heart’s blood, but flows down to us in a free channel; yea and that too even to the very chief of sinners. Therefore I have hope, and, blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    good hope through grace. Is not the same grace, dear Sir, sufficient for you and yours? Let us then come boldly to <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    throne. He sits encircled with a rainbow; his name and his nature is Love. He came into the world, to seek and save those that feel themselves lost; this I trust you do. Salvation then is just coming to your soul, even a present and great salvation. Only believe, and yours is the kingdom of heaven. But whither am I running? I forget myself when writing of redeeming love. O, my dear Sir, do not rest, do not let <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    have any rest, till your heart is filled with it. It is worth asking, seeking, knocking, and striving for. But I must have done. My cordial respects await your Lady. That you may both go on hand in hand to heaven, is the hearty prayer of, dear Sir,</p>

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HUS far hath a never-failing Redeemer brought me in my way towards <i>London</i>. With all humility and thankfulness of heart I desire to set up my <i>Ebenezer</i>: for surely hitherto hath the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    helped me. Since my writing last to
    <a id="p448"></a>your Ladyship, I went and preached for about a week at <i>Glasgow</i>, where the word of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    ran and was glorified. I preached twice a day, and rather more attended than at <i>Edinburgh</i>. We had a sorrowful parting at both places. For about twenty-eight days, I suppose I did not preach to less than ten thousand every day. This hath weakened my body, but the Redeemer knows how to renew my strength. At present, I am as well as a pilgrim can expect to be. About seventy pounds were collected for the <i>Edinburgh</i> orphans, and I hear that near a dozen young men that were awakened about ten years ago, have since entered upon the ministry, and are likely to prove very useful. Praise the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    O my soul!—In my way hither, I preached at <i>Berwick</i>, <i>Alnwick</i> and <i>Morpeth</i>; and next <i>Monday</i>, after preaching at <i>Sunderland</i>, as is intended, I am to go into <i>Yorkshire</i>. I know your Ladyship wishes me much prosperity. That your Ladyship may prosper more and more, and be in health both in soul and body, is the continual prayer of, ever-honoured Madam,</p>

    of all Lords to send me thither again, I purpose to pursue the same plan. For I am a debtor to all of all denominations, and have no design, if I know any thing of this desperately wicked and deceitful heart, but to promote the common salvation of mankind. The love of <span

    constrains me to this. Accept it as wrote from that principle. That He, who is the wonderful counsellor, may in all things direct and rule your hearts, is the earnest prayer of, my dear friend,</p>

    He will bless you for vindicating the honour of his sacred volumes in your last pamphlet, for which, as well as for all other unmerited favours, I most heartily thank you. I have just now read it, and doubt not of its being greatly blessed and owned, and going through many editions. I cannot discern any errata or inaccuracies in the composition. Surely <span

    hath raised my dear friend up, to let the polite world see how amiable are the doctrines of the gospel. Why will you weary the world, and your friends, by delaying to publish your other long wished-for performance? Glad shall I be to peruse any of the dialogues. The savour of the last is not of my mind. Pray let them see the light this Winter. They will delight and warm many a heart. O that we may have a warm season at the Tabernacle! My country circuit was exceedingly delightful. When the weather altered, my health was much affected; but a little rest hath already in some degree repaired it. You and I perhaps are not to see heaven as yet: I have waited for it long, but alas! my appointed time is not yet come. Thanks be to <span

    there is such a thing as having a heaven upon earth; <span

I know not of a more profitable situation, that you could be in than at present. Next year, <span

    Pray make <i>George</i> and the children to write often. He should not have written to me, <i>Honoured Master</i>, but—<i>Sir</i>. I am glad to hear that some of the children promise well. Surely some good will in the end come out of that institution, I am only afraid of its growing too great one day or another, in a worldly way. O that I may be directed to such managers, that will act with a single eye to <span

    glory, and his people’s good! I have great confidence in you. I am glad you live in peace. May the Prince of peace cause his grace and mercy to be multiplied upon you! I shall be glad to live to see you a preacher. It is a delightful employment, when done out of love to <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>:
    that sweetens all. In about ten weeks I have travelled above a thousand miles, and was enabled to preach sometimes twice and thrice a day to many thousands. I trust a great blessing was left behind with the word preached. O that <i>Georgia</i>’s wilderness may blossom like a rose! It will, when <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    set time is come. Never mind a few evil reports. No one need be ashamed of <i>Bethesda</i> children. Blessed be <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, they are taken care of, and the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    <a id="p454"></a>will reward you. Ah my dear <i>Nat</i>, you are highly honoured. I hope you often bow down before the blessed Redeemer, and out of the fulness of your heart say, “Why me, <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?
    why me?” Pray, pray, I beseech you continually, that you may be cloathed with humility. How many young men have I known ruined for the want of it! “<span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.” Pray that I may have an humble and thankful heart. I would vie with a seraph, if I could, in humility and thankfulness. Adieu. The <span

He that hath given your dear yoke-fellow a heart to seek after the pearl of great price, can make your children like-minded.

      class="smcap">God</span>,
    that the day dawns, and that the day-star hath risen in your heart. May the Redeemer give you a <i>Benjamin</i>’s mess every hour! He is our great <i>Joseph</i>, and loves to say to his guilty brethren, “Come near me.” Out of his fulness we may all receive even grace for grace. O how does he continually watch over us for good!

    Endeavour to obstruct they will, and young converts little know how resolutely, how unweariedly. The way to heaven is a round-about way: we must go through a wilderness. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    suffers this, to prove and try us, and to shew us what is in our hearts. Humility must be taught us, as <i>Gideon</i> taught the men of <i>Succoth</i>, with briars and thorns: these will frequently fetch blood from the old man. O that we may be made willing to have him bleed to death! “Away with him, away with him; crucify him, crucify him.” May this be the language of your heart and mine! To have this prayer answered, what trials must we necessarily meet with from the devil, the world, the flesh, and even from <span

    own children? All little enough to lead us into that mortified, pacific, resigned, and disinterested mind, which was in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.
    The more we suffer, and the less we are esteemed for doing, or attempting to do good for his great name’s sake, the more we are conformed to his blessed example. In heaven, justice will be done to all. Strange! that we cannot wait more patiently till the great day of retribution. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    help us to walk more by faith, and less by sense! “Help, O help us to leave ourselves and all with thee.” I know you will say, “<i>Amen</i>!” But I forget myself. How willingly does the pen write,
    <a id="p459"></a>when love, love for <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>’s
    sake dictates and indites! I thank you for enquiring after my welfare: thanks be to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I am as well as a poor, but happy pilgrim can expect to be. The shout of a king is amongst us. The glory of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    fills the Tabernacle; and we hear every day of persons brought under fresh awakenings, as well as of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>’s
    people being comforted. We have had two most awful sacramental occasions. Help me to cry, Grace! grace! I shall be glad to hear that the gospel runs and is glorified at <i>Wakefield</i>. Who knows but the last may be yet first? Is any thing too hard for the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>?

    <i>My dear Captain</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">O</span>NE would imagine, that you and I were never to meet any more on this side eternity. I often, often think of you, and long to see and converse with you; but <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    only knows when. We are now about to erect a <i>new Tabernacle</i> eighty foot square, which I fear will detain me in <i>England</i> the
    <a id="p463"></a>ensuing Summer. Pen cannot well describe, how white the fields have been, and how ready to harvest, in <i>Wales</i>, <i>Scotland</i>, and the <i>North</i> of <i>England</i>. I could sometimes scarce tell, whether I was in or out of the body. Grace! grace! I am now in Winter quarters, where our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    gives us fresh conquests, gained by his word every day. We do not dispute, but love. I find more and more that truth is great; and however seemingly crush’d for a while, will in the end prevail. But there must be a kind of death upon every promise, and upon every thing that is done for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    Thus hath it been with <i>Georgia</i> and <i>Bethesda</i>. O that we may learn to wait! Then shall we certainly see the salvation of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    I pity our dear friends in <i>Charles-Town</i>. O <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    how great are thy judgments, as well as thy mercies! May they hear the rod, and who hath appointed it! My soul is distressed for them. May this severe correction make them truly great! When you send any thing to <i>Savannah</i>, I should be obliged to you, if you would send a few things to <i>Bethesda</i>. Our <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    will bless you for it. I hope there are now above twenty negroes at work upon the new plantation. May the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    convert them, and every other member of my family! And O that I may be converted myself more and more every day and hour! I am ashamed of my being such a dwarf in religion, and of my having so little of the mind of <span
      class="smcap">Christ</span>.
    I hope you, my dear old friend, do find his grace sufficient for you, to keep your heart above the world, and continually alive to <span
      class="smcap">God</span>.
    My prayer for you is, that you may have power to get wealth, and grace to improve it for the Redeemer’s glory, and his people’s good: then you will be rich for both worlds, and <span
      class="smcap">God</span>, even your own <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    will give you and yours his blessing. Why do you not write to dear <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>S――</i>?
    He is a heavenly-minded man indeed, and my bosom friend. I suppose <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>D――</i>
    will acquaint you of my having been at his house; we are kind friends still: he and his very much regard you. What cannot <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    do? How faithful is he to those, who “seek first his kingdom, and the righteousness thereof.” Let these words be written over your store-house door; or rather let them be written on the table of your heart. I can add no more. A variety of business demands my attention. My dear man, farewel. Had I wings, I would fly
    <a id="p464"></a>and see you, and my other never to be forgotten <i>Philadelphia</i> friends. Continue to pray, and perhaps I may yet come sooner than expectation.

  <p>
    <i>My dear Friend</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have read and pondered upon your kind letter with some degree of solemnity of spirit. In the same frame I would now sit down to answer it. And what shall I say? Really I can scarce tell. The connection between you and your brother, hath been so close and continued, and your attachment to him so necessary to keep up his interest, that I would not willingly for the world do or say any thing that may separate such friends. I cannot help thinking, but he is still jealous of me and my proceedings; but, I thank <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I am quite easy about it. Having the testimony of a good conscience, that I have a disinterested view to promote the common salvation only, I can leave all to him, who I am assured will in the end speak for me, and make my righteousness as clear as the light, and my just dealing as the noon-day. I more and more find, that he who believeth doth not make haste; and that if we will have patience, we shall find that every plant, which our heavenly Father hath not planted, however it may seem to have taken very deep root, shall be plucked up. As I wrote to good Lady <i>H――n</i>, so I write to you, dear Sir.—I bless <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    for my stripping seasons. I have seen an end of all perfection, and expect it only in him, where I am sure to find it, even in the ever-loving, ever-lovely <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>.
    He knows how I love and honour you, and your brother, and how often I have preferred your interest to my own. This, by the grace of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    I shall still continue to do. My reward is with the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    If he approves, it is enough. More might be said, were we face to face. When this will be, I cannot tell. Several
    <a id="p465"></a>things, especially our design of building a new tabernacle, which I hope will succeed, detain me in town this Winter. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    only knows what course I am to steer in the Spring. I would be a blank;—let my heavenly Father fill it up as seemeth him good. I am glad you are with our elect Lady; she will shine indeed in heaven as a common friend. O how amiable is a truly catholic spirit! <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    make us all partakers of it more and more! I beg the continuance of your prayers: I need them much. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    willing, you shall have mine in return. That you and yours may increase with all the increase of <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    is the earnest request of, my dear friend,</p>

    <i>London, <abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr> 22, 1752.</i></p>
  <p>
    <i>Ever-honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH great pleasure I received your Ladyship’s letter, which hath drawn me to the Father of Spirits, that the meek, lowly, loving, zealous, and heavenly-minded temper which was in <span
      class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
    may be stamped more and more upon your Ladyship’s heart. A growth in these blessed graces and fruits of the divine Spirit, I am persuaded is what your Ladyship desires above all things under heaven, and I doubt not but all the trials and afflictions you meet with, both from friends and foes, will be sanctified to the promoting this glorious end. Many of these I meet with; but if I come purified out of the furnace, and am at length any way conformed to my dear and blessed Exemplar, I rejoice, yea and will rejoice. Experience, if attended with this effect, cannot be bought too dear. But alas, how unwilling is the old man to be crucified and slain! How hard is even the mind that is renewed in part, how hard to be brought off low and selfish and party views. With how much reluctance doth it give up the uppermost place, and submit to be accounted in the church, as well as in the world, less than the least of all. Yet this is a lesson the witnesses of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>
    must learn. O that I had learnt only my A B C in it! I beg the continuance of your Ladyship’s prayers, for which I thank your Ladyship a thousand times.
    <a id="p466"></a>May the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of all lords return them seven-fold into your bosom, and give your Ladyship success in your endeavours to serve the persons mentioned in your last! It is but for your Ladyship to try. I shall observe your Ladyship’s hints about <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> ――.
    I believe our visits will not be very frequent.—But I am easy, having no scheme, no design of supplanting or resenting, but I trust a single eye to promote the common salvation, without so much as attempting to set up a party for myself. This is what my soul abhors. Being thus minded, I have peace; peace which the world knows nothing of, and which all must necessarily be strangers to, who are fond either of power or numbers. <span
      class="smcap">God</span>
    be praised for the many strippings I have met with: it is good for me that I have been supplanted, despised, censured, maligned, judged by, and separated from my nearest, dearest friends. By this I have found the faithfulness of him, who is the friend of friends; by this I have been taught to wrap myself in the glorious <i>Emmanuel</i>’s everlasting righteousness, and to be content that He, to whom all hearts are open, and all desires are known, now sees, and will let all see hereafter, the uprightness of my intentions towards all mankind. But whither am I going? I run too fast. Your Ladyship’s kind letter hath extorted this from me. I will weary your Ladyship no longer, but hasten to subscribe myself, what I really am, ever-honoured Madam,</p>
  <p class="blk_90 align_ctr">

But would you be a <i>Nehemiah</i>, and have no <i>Sanballat</i> to oppose you? Building the walls of the <i>New-Jerusalem</i>, is what the profane and formalists do not approve of. We must expect the serpent will hiss, whenever the gospel seed of the woman is coming into a place to bruise his head. Courage, my dear Sir, courage. <span

O happy they who are rich in faith and good works! These are the true riches; they are durable; they follow us beyond the grave, and we shall be reaping the fruit of them through the endless ages of eternity. Eternity! eternity!

    Blessed be his name, that his spirit is moving on precious souls at <i>Bristol</i>. For ever adored be his rich, free, and unmerited grace, the same may be said of <i>London</i>. We have had blessed holidays, and I have had good news from the Orphan-house.</p>

    <i>Ever-honoured Madam</i>,</p>
  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="dropcap">Y</span>OUR Ladyship’s very kind and christian letter, I have read over and over again. It drew my heart towards the Redeemer, and caused me to pray, that your present retirement, may be a glorious preparative for further, and yet more public usefulness in his mystical body. To have one’s hands or tongue tied from acting or speaking for <span
      class="smcap">God</span>,
    is, to a new and heaven-born soul, one of the greatest pieces of self-denial in the world. But this hath been the lot of many of the most choice and holy souls under heaven. It is a mercy, that where there is a willing mind, it is accepted according to that which a man hath, and not according to that which he hath not. I beg that your Ladyship would not have the least thought about my concerns, otherwise than at a throne of grace. Your Ladyship wants a bridle, rather than a spur. My highest ambition is to spend and be spent for <span
      class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and
    <a id="p475"></a>to be not the head, but servant of all. When your Ladyship mentioned the word <i>ambition</i>, I could not help thinking of the saying of the <i>Eunuch</i>, “Speaketh the prophet this of himself, or of some other man?” But we know not what is in our hearts. <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    keep me from being led into, and falling by temptation. I wish your Ladyship much success with <i>B――</i>, but worldly wise men, serpent-like, so turn and wind, that they have many ways to slip through and creep out at, which simple-hearted single-eyed souls know nothing of, and if they did, could not follow after them. Honesty is the best policy, and will in the end (whether we seek it or not) get the better of all. Your Ladyship’s intended letter to Governor <i>B――</i>, will be very acceptable. I hope the inclosed will give your Ladyship pleasure. O that I may be enabled to give the <span
      class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>
    all the glory! To me nought belongs, but confusion of face. Surely I am the chief of sinners, less than the least of all saints, but for <span

I doubt not of its becoming a seat of learning in time, but it is good for every thing to rise gradually. I have engaged a dear youth, who I trust will suit the Orphan-house infant state very well. It hath scarce learnt as yet to stand upon its own legs; as it grows I expect it will give me more trouble. To have young men educated there, and then turned out into the church graceless and unconverted would break my heart. Father, if it be thy will, let this cup pass from me! I suppose we shall now soon know, who is to be Governor; every thing is to be ordered as I informed you in my last. My eyes are waiting upon Him, from whom alone cometh all our salvation.

When we meet next, remember that a floor and blanket is all the lodging, and a chick or fowl, boiled or roasted, is all the food I desire at <i>Ebenezer</i>. What is a pilgrim life without a pilgrim heart? O that I was like my <span

    Then should I endure hardness, like a good soldier of <span
      class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.—The
    encouragement for raising silk will be continued. O that <i>Georgia</i> may prove a fruitful soil for raising children unto <i>Abraham</i>! We wait for thy salvation, O <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>.
    For the present, reverend Sir, adieu. My wife joins in sending cordial salutations to your whole self, to <abbr
      title="Mister">Mr.</abbr> <i>L――</i>
    and his wife, and all the dear people at <i>Ebenezer</i>. That you all may at all times have reason to say, “hitherto hath our <span

    helped us,” is the earnest prayer of, reverend and very dear Sir,</p>
  <p class="blk_90 align_ctr">

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
